{"data": "Table of Contents \n \nResearch and Patents\n \nResearch and product development constitutes an important part of 3M\u2019s activities and has been a major driver of 3M\u2019s sales and profit growth. Research,\ndevelopment and related expenses totaled $1.821 billion in 2018, $1.870 billion in 2017 and $1.764 billion in 2016. Research and development, covering\nbasic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.253 billion\nin 2018, $1.352 billion in 2017 and $1.248 billion in 2016. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which\ninclude costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process\nresearch and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects\nand impairments.\n \nThe Company\u2019s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign\npatents. The Company\u2019s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. Patents applicable to\nspecific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various\ncountries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of\npatent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.\n \nThe Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of\nrelated patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company\u2019s business segments.\n \nRaw Materials\n \nIn 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy\nproductivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and\nmulti-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the\nCompany is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future\nshortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful\nmanagement of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources.\n3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n \nEnvironmental Law Compliance\n \n3M\u2019s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to continue making,\nnecessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past\noperations at certain sites (refer to \u201cEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\u201d in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).\n \nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed.\nReserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally\nno later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company\u2019s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental\nexpenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n \nIn 2018, 3M expended approximately $27 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for\nremediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. Capital\nexpenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices \u2014 such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers,\ncontainment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers \u2014 at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of\nbusiness. Consistent with the Company\u2019s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known\nprojects are presently expected to be approximately $75 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify\nmanufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.\n \n7\n \n", "page_num": 7}

The Company may also make forward-\nlooking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In\naddition, the Company\u2019s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.\n \nForward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company\u2019s expected future business and financial performance. Words such as\n\u201cplan,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201caim,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cforecast\u201d and other words and terms\nof similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements.

{"data": "Table of Contents \nForward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual\nfuture results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of\nfactors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the headings of \u201cOverview,\u201d \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d and annually in \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates.\u201d Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of this document, and should be\nconsidered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d For additional\ninformation concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on\nForm 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.\n \nItem 1A.  Risk Factors  \n \nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors\nis incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and\nResults of Operations.\u201d\n \n* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions. The Company operates in more\nthan 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company\u2019s business is subject to global\ncompetition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as\nslower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions,\ninflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade\nrestrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in\nthe various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or\nclimate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest\nrates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n \n* Change in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase cost of funding. The Company\u2019s credit ratings are important to 3M\u2019s cost of capital. The major\nrating agencies routinely evaluate the Company\u2019s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which\ninclude financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has\nan AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor\u2019s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings have served to lower 3M\u2019s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the\nCompany\u2019s capital structure could impact 3M\u2019s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n \n* The Company\u2019s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. Demand for the Company\u2019s products, which impacts revenue\nand profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company\u2019s response to downward\npricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of\ncustomer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company\u2019s incentive programs, or the customer\u2019s ability to achieve\nincentive goals; (iv) changes in customers\u2019 preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in\ncustomer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to\ndisruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available\ndata.\n \n* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and\nearnings. Because the Company\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company\u2019s revenues are\nderived from outside the United States, the Company\u2019s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be\nadversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\n \n10\n \n", "page_num": 10}
{"data": "Table of Contents \n* The Company\u2019s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to\ncontinually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in\nproduct development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of\nnew products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n \n* The Company\u2019s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy,\nincluding oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters\nand other factors. The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their\nderivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural\nand other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Company\u2019s receipt of adequate supplies could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no\nassurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company.\n \n* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business\nstrategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. The Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure\nand has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to\nacquisitions, future results will be affected by the Company\u2019s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.\n \n* The Company\u2019s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated. The Company utilizes various\ntools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and\ninternal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing\n3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource\nplanning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized.\n \n* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP system as part of\nbusiness transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information\ntechnology infrastructure could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers,\nand employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business,\nthe Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process,\ntransmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data,\nincluding proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to\nprivacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training,\nmonitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company\u2019s information technology networks and\ninfrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power\noutages, computer viruses, ransomware, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service or cloud provider breaches, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including several years. While we have\nexperienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of vulnerabilities to the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure,\nnone of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its\nERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruptions or\nshutdowns, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Although the Company maintains insurance\ncoverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\n \n* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results. The\nperformance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in\nmarket interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan\n11\n \n", "page_num": 11}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nassets, and relevant legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and\nadversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n \n* The Company\u2019s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product\nliability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, or other matters.\nThe outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company\u2019s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are\noften difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance\nreceivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or\njudgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable\ndevelopment could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows in any particular\nperiod.

Additionally in December 2018, 3M completed the sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration\nservices portion of the business based in Germany and reflected a pre-tax gain of $15 million as a result of this divestiture. Both divestitures were\nreported within the Company\u2019s Electronics and Energy business.  During the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, management approved\nand committed to undertake certain restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets\nDivision divestiture. These actions affected approximately 1,200 positions worldwide and resulted in a second quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of\n$105 million and a fourth quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of $22 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates. The aggregate net\nimpact of the gain on sale and related restructuring actions increased earnings per diluted share by 2 cents and 50 cents per diluted share for the\nfourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, and reflects the specific income tax rate associated with these items.\n \nYear 2017 EPS:\n \n2017 divestiture of identity management business:\n\u00b7\nIn May 2017, 3M completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable of its identity management business and reflected a pre-tax gain\nof $457 million.

These benefits were partially offset by\nhigher defined benefit pension service cost expenses. During 2017, organic growth and productivity were the primary drivers for the year-on-year\nbenefit.\n\u00b7\nYear-on-year incremental strategic investments decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $413 million in 2017.

Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related primarily to the acquisition of Scott\nSafety (fourth quarter 2017). The net impact related to Scott Safety included income from operations, more than offset by the transaction and\nintegration costs of the acquisition. Interest expense related to financing costs of Scott Safety are also included. The net impact related to Scott\nSafety was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share.

Under the terms of the\nsettlement, 3M agreed to provide an $850 million grant to the State for a special \u201c3M Water Quality and Sustainability Fund.\u201d This Fund will enable\nprojects that support water sustainability in the Twin Cities East Metro region, such as continued delivery of water to residents and enhancing groundwater\nrecharge to support sustainable growth. The projects will also result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space\npreservation. 3M recorded a charge of $897 million ($710 million after-tax), inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018\nassociated with the resolution of this matter. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a related $60 million tax expense resulting from the Company\u2019s\nongoing IRS examination under the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) and new guidance released under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Also during the\nfirst quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a tax expense of $217 million related to a measurement period adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded in\nDecember 2017 from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). In the fourth quarter 2018, 3M finalized the tax impact related to TCJA with a\nreversal of previously recorded tax expense in the amount of $41 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The\nexpense was primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and was net of remeasurement of\n3M\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA\u2019s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount was subject to\nadjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by SEC guidance.\nIn addition to providing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of the\nNRD resolution and enactment/measurement period adjustments to the impact of the enactment of the TCJA. These items represent significant\ncharges/benefits that impacted the Company\u2019s financial results. Operating income, operating income margin, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings\nper share are all measures for which 3M provides the GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are\nthey a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company\u2019s operations. The\nCompany believes that discussion of\n19\n \n", "page_num": 19}

Selling prices were flat year-on-year for 2017. In Asia Pacific, strong volume growth in electronics had a\nnegative impact on price. Latin America/Canada and EMEA had price growth, while the U.S. selling prices declined slightly.\n \nFinancial condition:\n \n3M generated $6.4 billion of operating cash flow in 2018, an increase of $199 million when compared to 2017. This followed a decrease of $422 million\nwhen comparing 2017 to 2016. Refer to the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash\nflows. In November 2018, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\u2019s outstanding common stock, which replaced the\nCompany\u2019s February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own\nstock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion in 2017 and $3.8 billion in 2016. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion of its own stock\nin 2019. In February 2019, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the\n61st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor\u2019s and an A1\ncredit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital\nmarkets funding throughout business cycles.\n \nRaw materials:\n \nIn 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy\nproductivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and\nmulti-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the\nCompany is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future\nshortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful\nmanagement of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources.\n3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n \n Pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\n \nOn a worldwide basis, 3M\u2019s pension and postretirement plans were 89 percent funded at year-end 2018. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is\napproximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 96 percent funded and the international pension plans were 89 percent funded. The U.S.\nnon-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2018 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were -\n0.5%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified\npension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2019 is 7.00%. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2018\ndiscount rate was 4.36%, up 0.68 percentage points from the year-end 2017 discount rate of 3.68%. The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a\ndecrease valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan\u2019s funded status increased 2 percentage points in 2018\ndue to the lower PBO resulting from the significant discount rate increase and a $200 million contribution to the plan. Additional detail and discussion of\ninternational plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).\n \n3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2019. The\nCompany does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and\npostretirement expense in 2019 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $130 million pre-tax\nwhen compared to 2018. Refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d within MD&A and Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional\ninformation concerning 3M\u2019s pension and post-retirement plans.\n \n26\n \n", "page_num": 26}

A number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material\ncost management, portfolio and footprint actions, divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement service cost effects.\nExpanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. Pension and postretirement service cost expense is\nrecorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M\u2019s\ndefined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense increased $21 million in 2018, compared to an increase of $16 million in 2017. Refer to\nNote 13 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for the service cost components of net periodic benefit costs.\n \nThe Company is investing in an initiative called business transformation, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. Business\ntransformation encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, as well\nas changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M.\n \nCost of Sales:\n \nCost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.\n \nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, increased during 2018 primarily due to foreign currency effects (net of hedge losses). Additionally, cost of\nsales for full year 2018 were increased by the second quarter 2018 and fourth quarter 2018 Communication Markets Division related restructuring charges\nas discussed in Note 5. This increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018, and\nselling price increases. Selling prices increased net sales year-on-year by 1.1 percent for full year 2018. These were partially offset by raw material cost\nincreases and higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense.\n \nCost of sales as a percent of sales increased during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments in productivity, portfolio actions and footprint\noptimization, foreign currency effects (net of hedge impacts) and higher defined benefit pension expense. This was partially offset by a year-on-year\nreduction in raw material input costs as a result of sourcing cost reduction projects.

{"data": "Table of Contents \n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n \nSG&A in dollars increased 14.7 percent for full year 2018 when compared to the same period last year.

In addition, 3M divested a polymer additives compounding business, formerly part of the Company\u2019s Industrial business, and reflected a gain\non final closing adjustments from a prior divestiture which, in aggregate, were not material. These divestitures resulted in a gain on sale of businesses of\n$24 million. 3M also divested an abrasives glass products business, formerly part of the Company\u2019s Industrial business, which resulted in a gain on sale of\nless than $15 million in the second quarter of 2018. Also, 3M reflected an immaterial gain from an earnout on a previous divestiture in the fourth quarter of\n2018.\n \nIn June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division to Corning Incorporated. This business, with annual sales\nof approximately $400 million, consists of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry including 3M\u2019s\nxDSL, FTTx, and structured cabling solutions and, in certain countries, telecommunications system integration services. This divestiture resulted in a gain\non sale of $494 million. In December 2018, the Company completed the sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration services portion of\nthe business based in Germany, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15 million. Both the June 2018 and December 2018 divestiture impacts were reported within\nthe Company\u2019s Electronics and Energy business.\n \nRefer to Note 3 for additional detail on these divestitures. 3M also divested certain businesses in 2017 and 2016, resulting in gains of $586 million and $111\nmillion, respectively.

{"data": "Table of Contents \nInterest expense increased during 2018 and 2017 due to higher average debt balances and higher U.S. borrowing costs. In addition, in October 2017, via\ncash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment\ncharge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was included within interest expense. Capitalized interest related to property, plant and\nequipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.\n \nInterest income increased year-on-year in both 2018 and 2017 due to higher average interest rates.\n \nEffective January 1, 2018, in conjunction with 3M\u2019s adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, all pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost components\n(except the service cost component) are reported within other expense (income), net. For additional details, refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting\nPolicies). Year-on-year pension and postretirement net periodic benefit non-service costs increased $55 million and $68 million for the year 2018 and 2017,\nrespectively. The year-on-year increases were primarily due to an increase in the net actuarial amortization expense.\n \n Provision for Income Taxes:\n \n(Percent of pre-tax income)\n    \n2018\n    \n2017\n    \n2016\n \nEffective tax rate\n \n23.4 % \n35.5 % \n28.3 %\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2018 was 23.4 percent, compared to 35.5 percent in 2017, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2017 was\n35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points. The changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many\nfactors, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017 as further described in the Overview, \u201cIncome, earnings per\nshare, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -(non-GAAP measures)\u201d section and in Note 10. During the fourth\nquarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the TCJA. As a result of finalizing estimates related to TCJA,\nthe Company recorded additional net charges in the amount of $176 million as measurement period adjustments in 2018. The expense is primarily related to\nthe TCJA\u2019s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M\u2019s deferred tax assets and\nliabilities.\n \nThe TCJA establishes new tax laws that affected 2018 and will affect future periods, including, but not limited to: 1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate\ntax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, 2) the creation of a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), 3) addition of\nprovisions incentivizing foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), 4) significant change to the U.S. federal tax implications of dividends, 5) limitations on\nthe deductibility of certain executive compensation, and 6) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction. Considering the impacts of the TCJA\nand other factors, the Company currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2019 will be approximately 20 to 22 percent. The tax rate can vary from quarter\nto quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, and employee share-based payment accounting; as well as\nrecurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.\n \nRefer to Note 10 for further discussion of income taxes.\n \nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest:\n \n(Millions)\n2018\n    \n2017\n    \n2016\n \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n$\n14  \n$\n11  \n$\n 8  \n \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M\nconsolidated entities.

Refer to Note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning 3M\u2019s hedging activities. \n \nPERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEG MENT\n \nFor a detailed discussion of the markets served and types of products offered by 3M\u2019s business segments, see Item 1, Business Segments. Financial\ninformation and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective in the first quarter of 2018, as part of 3M\u2019s\ncontinuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes:\n \nConsolidation of customer account activity within international countries \u2013 expanding dual credit reporting\n\u00b7\nThe Company consolidated its customer account activity in each country into centralized sales districts for certain countries that make up\napproximately 70 percent of 3M\u2019s 2017 international net sales. Expansion of these initiatives, which previously had been deployed only in the\nU.S., reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual\ncredit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides\ncustomer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. The expansion of alignment of customer accounts within\nadditional countries increased the attribution of dual credit across 3M\u2019s business segments. Additionally, certain sales and operating income\nresults for electronic bonding product lines that were previously equally divided between the Electronics and Energy business segment and the\nIndustrial business segment are now reported similarly to dual credit.\n \nCentralization of manufacturing and supply technology platforms\n\u00b7\nCertain shared film manufacturing and supply technology platform resources formerly reflected within the Electronics and Energy business\nsegment were combined with other shared and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated.\n \nIn addition, as discussed in Note 1, 3M adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic\nPostretirement Benefit Cost, effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. As a result, operating income for 3M\u2019s business segments has been revised\nto reflect non-service components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs within other expense (income), net.\n \nBusiness segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five business\nsegments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer.\n \nCorporate and Unallocated:\n \nIn addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to \u201cCorporate and Unallocated,\u201d which is presented separately in the preceding\nbusiness segments table and in Note 18. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and\nlosses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring\ncharges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its\nbusiness segments. Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other\narrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its divestiture in 2018. Because this category includes a variety of\nmiscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n \nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $1.1 billion in full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017. Beginning in the second quarter\nof 2018, the operating income from contractual manufacturing and other arrangements described in the paragraph above were included in Corporate and\nUnallocated. In addition, in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, operating expenses included the restructuring charge of $105 million and $22\nmillion, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates, respectively, as discussed in Note 5 related to addressing corporate functional costs following\nthe Communication Markets Division divestiture. In the first quarter of 2018, the Minnesota NRD resolution ($897 million), inclusive of legal fees and\nother related\n32\n \n", "page_num": 32}

In addition, 3M\u2019s defined benefit pension and postretirement service-cost expense allocation to\nCorporate and Unallocated increased year-on-year.\n \nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $74 million in 2017 when compared to 2016. In both the first and second quarters of 2017, a\nportion of the severance actions were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In the fourth quarter, an incremental $58 million was reflected within\nCorporate and Unallocated related to the Company\u2019s actuarial adjustments to its respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual. In addition, 3M\u2019s defined benefit\npension and postretirement service cost expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated increased by approximately $30 million in 2017. \n \nOperating Business Segments:\n \nInformation related to 3M\u2019s business segments is presented in the tables that follow.

A portion of the products or components sold by 3M\u2019s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different\ngeographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M\u2019s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular\ngeographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area.

As stated in Note 1, the preparation of\nfinancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,\nand related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n \nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement obligations, asset\nimpairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the\nAudit Committee of 3M\u2019s Board of Directors.\n \nLegal Proceedings:\n \nThe categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related\ninsurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cProcess for Disclosure and\nRecording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings\u201d (contained in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 16) for additional information\nabout such estimates.\n \n Pension and Postretirement Obligations:\n \n 3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The\nprimary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension\nand postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation \u2014\nRetirement Benefits, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires\nemployers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of\nfinancial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income,\nwhich is a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are\n39\n \n", "page_num": 39}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nappropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial\ninstruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in\ndetermining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.\n \nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant\u2019s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or\ntermination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of\nthe measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period\nand discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments\nthat would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately\nusing the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to\nthe service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit\npayments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in\nthe actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n \nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n \n \nU.S. Qualified\nPension\n    \nInternational\nPension (weighted\naverage)\n    \nU.S.\nPostretirement\nMedical\n \nDecember 31, 2018 Liability:\n \n  \n  \n  \nBenefit obligation\n \n4.36 %\n2.50 %\n4.28 %\n2019 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\n \n  \n  \n  \nService cost\n \n4.47 %\n2.36 %\n4.45 %\nInterest cost\n \n4.04 %\n2.26 %\n3.93 %\n \nAnother significant element in determining the Company\u2019s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is\nbased on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management.\nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2019 is 7.00%, a decrease from 7.25% in 2018.\nRefer to Note 13 for information on how the 2018 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement\nbenefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average\nexpected return for the international pension plan is 4.90% for 2019, compared to 5.02% for 2018.\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of\n$483 million and a benefit of $73 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special\ntermination benefits and other) for a total  consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $410 million, up from $334 million in\n2017.\n \nIn 2019, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $420 million while non-service pension and\npostretirement net benefit costs (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $140\nmillion, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $280 million, a decrease of approximately $130 million\ncompared to 2018.\n \nThe table below summarizes the impact on 2019 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease\nin the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2018 net periodic benefit cost.

{"data": "Table of Contents \nAsset Impairments:\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.7 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $2.7 billion. Management\nmakes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This\nincludes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are\nclosely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an\nimpairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.\n \nOf the $2.7 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520\nmillion at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating\nthe fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to\nestimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated\nroyalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book\nvalue of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter\nof 2018, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent\nin aggregate.\n \n3M goodwill totaled approximately $10.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. 3M\u2019s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of\neach year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level\nbelow the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At\n3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.\n \nAn impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit,\nand the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a\nprice/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for\nstable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted\ncash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method\nindicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than\nplanned due to economic or other conditions.\n \nAs described in Note 18, effective in the first quarter of 2018, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that resulted in\nreporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the\nfirst quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and\ndetermined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2018 annual impairment test and is in the context of\nthe reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n \nAs of October 1, 2018, 3M had 24 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 89 percent of the goodwill. These ten\nreporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health\nInformation Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification, and\nTransportation Safety. The estimated fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 79 percent or more. 3M\u2019s market\nvalue at both December 31, 2018, and September 30, 2018, was significantly in excess of its shareholders\u2019 equity of approximately $10 billion.\n \nAs discussed in Note 3, 3M sold its Communication Markets division in 2018, which comprised substantially all of the $272 million reduction in goodwill\nassociated with divestitures during 2018.\n \nIn 2018, 3M determined fair values using either an industry price-earnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows analysis. Where applicable, 3M used a\nweighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were\n41\n \n", "page_num": 41}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nweighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management\u2019s estimates of the\nlikelihood of each scenario occurring.\n \n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M\u2019s\nbusinesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M\u2019s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M\u2019s value being comprised\nof internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2018, no goodwill\nimpairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.\n \nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive\nconditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of\nthis document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first\nquarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting\nunits and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M\nwould expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in\n2019 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n \n Income Taxes:\n \nThe extent of 3M\u2019s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of\njurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of\ndisputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax\naudit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The\nCompany follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for\nadditional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these\nuncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company\u2019s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the\nCompany\u2019s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these\namounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period\nwhen the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n \nStarting in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continuing into 2018, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n(TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and remeasurement of\n3M\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities. As discussed in Note 10, this expense was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n \nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEM ENTS\n \nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \n42\n \n", "page_num": 42}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI TY\n \nThe strength and stability of 3M\u2019s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, positions the Company\nto be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3M\u2019s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital\ndeployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be\nsupplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for\ncash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund\ndividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities\nfor 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For those\ninternational earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S.\noperations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n \n3M\u2019s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to\nthe commercial paper market. 3M\u2019s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum\nmaturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2018, there was approximately $435 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.\n \nTotal Debt:\n \nThe strength of 3M\u2019s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\u2019s\nmaturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA-\ncredit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor\u2019s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\n \nThe Company\u2019s total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to September\n2018 debt issuances of $2.25 billion along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency\neffects. These were partially offset by August 2018 and November 2018 maturation of $450 million and 500 million Euro, respectively, aggregate principal\namount of medium-term notes in addition to commercial paper of $435 million outstanding at year end 2018 compared to $745 million outstanding at year\nend 2017. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following \u201cCash Flows from Financing Activities\u201d section.\n \nEffective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate\namount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\u2019s previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in\nconnection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time)\nof the Company\u2019s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous\naggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. \n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012,\n2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and the 2018 debt referenced above, is approximately $15.3 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of\nissuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note\n12.\n \nIn March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year\nrevolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion\n(at lenders\u2019 discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2018. Under the $3.75 billion\ncredit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is\ncalculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on\nall funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\nApart from the committed facilities, an additional $243 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2018.

Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a\nsubstitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average\ninvested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. The calculation is\nprovided in the below table.\n \nIn 2018, ROIC of 22.2 percent was higher than 2017.  The increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was negatively impacted by the measurement period\nadjustments taken in 2018 to the expense recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA, the impact from the resolution of the Minnesota\nnatural resource damages (NRD) resolution, and the impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions\nrelated to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture, which combined reduced ROIC by 2 percentage points in 2018.\n \nIn 2017, ROIC of 21.3 percent was lower than 2016. This decrease related to the net impact of the enactment of the TCJA and increases in commercial\npaper borrowings in conjunction with the December 2017 U.S. defined benefit pension plan contribution, which combined reduced ROIC by 3 percentage\npoints in 2017.\n \nYears ended December 31\n        \n \n        \n \n        \n \n \n \n(Millions)\n \n2018\n \n2017\n \n2016\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReturn on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure)\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \nNet income including non-controlling interest\n \n$\n5,363  \n$\n4,869  $\n5,058   \nInterest expense (after-tax) (1)\n \n \n268  \n \n208  \n \n143   \nAdjusted net income (Return)\n \n$\n5,631  \n$\n5,077  \n$\n5,201   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \nAverage shareholders' equity (including non-controlling interest) (2)\n \n$\n10,407  \n$\n11,627  $\n11,316   \nAverage short-term and long-term debt (3)\n \n \n14,912  \n \n12,156   \n11,725   \nAverage invested capital\n \n$\n25,318  \n$\n23,783  $\n23,041   \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n   \nReturn on invested capital (non-GAAP measure)\n \n \n22.2 %  \n21.3 %  \n22.6 %  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n(1) Effective income tax rate used for interest expense\n \n \n23.4 %  \n35.5 %  \n28.3 %  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n(2) Calculation of average equity (includes non-controlling interest)\n \n \n  \n \n   \n   \nEnding total equity as of:\n \n \n  \n \n   \n   \nMarch 31\n \n$\n11,039  \n$\n11,040  $\n11,495   \nJune 30\n \n \n10,428  \n \n11,644   \n11,658   \nSeptember 30\n \n \n10,311  \n \n12,202   \n11,769   \nDecember 31\n \n \n9,848  \n \n11,622   \n10,343   \nAverage total equity\n \n$\n10,407  \n$\n11,627  $\n11,316   \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n(3) Calculation of average debt\n \n \n  \n \n   \n   \nEnding short-term and long-term debt as of:\n \n \n  \n \n   \n   \nMarch 31\n \n$\n15,660  \n$\n11,711  $\n11,139   \nJune 30\n \n \n14,519  \n \n11,301   \n11,749   \nSeptember 30\n \n \n14,846  \n \n11,663   \n12,361   \nDecember 31\n \n \n14,622  \n \n13,949   \n11,650   \nAverage short-term and long-term debt\n \n$\n14,912  \n$\n12,156  $\n11,725   \n \n45\n \n", "page_num": 45}

The increase was partially offset primarily due to the Minnesota NRD\nresolution in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were\nincreases in inventory and accounts receivable.

The expense is primarily\nrelated to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax. The transition tax is payable over 8 years at the election of the taxpayer. As discussed in Note 10, this balance was\nfinalized in 2018.\n \nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company.\nIncluded in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service\nagreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase\nobligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure\navailability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional\npurchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company\u2019s\nexpected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for\nwhich the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M\u2019s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment.\nFor this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company\u2019s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.\n \nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled \u201cUnconditional purchase obligations and other,\u201d include the current portion of\nthe liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months, when applicable. The Company is\nnot able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the\nlong-term portion of the total net tax liability of $655 million is excluded from the preceding table. In addition, the transition tax prescribed under the Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is separately included in the table above. Refer to Note 10 for further details.\n \nAs discussed in Note 13, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019 and Company\ncontributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are\nnot included in the preceding table.\n \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMEN TS\n \nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows\ndenominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and\nfloating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to\nexchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal\namount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n \n50\n \n", "page_num": 50}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nRefer to Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk,\ncommodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.\n \nItem 7A. Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n \nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest\nrates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management provides oversight for risk\nmanagement and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company\u2019s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative\ninstrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit\napproval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n \nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and\nforward and option contracts. However, the Company\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to\ncredit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The\nCompany does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n \nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\n \nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations\nin cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The\nCompany enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in\nforeign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the\noccurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the\nforecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to\noffset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing\ntransactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging\ninstruments to hedge portions of the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s\nforeign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.4 billion at December 31, 2018. The\ndollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $2.5\nbillion at December 31, 2018. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Company had 4.1 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency\ndenominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 14 in the \u201cNet Investment\nHedges\u201d section.\n \nInterest Rates Risk:\n \nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense\nusing a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges.\nUnder these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by\nreference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional\namount of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018 was $2.4 billion. Additional details about 3M\u2019s long-term debt can be found in Note\n12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company\u2019s\nlong-term debt.\n \nCommodity Prices Risk:\n \nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. The related\nmark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in\nthe period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company may enter into other commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuation\nand costs associated with the use of certain commodities and\n51\n \n", "page_num": 51}

These instruments are not designated in hedged relationships and the extent to which they were outstanding at December 31, 2018 was not\nmaterial.\n \nValue At Risk:\n \nThe value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company\u2019s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A\nMonte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments (primarily debt), derivatives and\nunderlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2018. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time\nhorizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 9 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and commodity prices related to five\ncommodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge\ntransactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The following table summarizes the possible adverse\nand positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.\n \n \n \nAdverse impact on after-tax\n \nPositive impact on after-tax\n \n \n \nearnings\n \nearnings\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2018\n    \n2017\n    \n2018\n    \n2017\n \nForeign exchange rates\n $\n(290) \n$\n(242) $\n305  \n$\n253  \nInterest rates\n \n \n(20) \n \n(15) \n \n17  \n \n14  \nCommodity prices\n \n \n(6) \n \n(3) \n \n 8  \n \n 3  \n \nIn addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates, recent historical information is as\nfollows. 3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $42 million and $111 million in 2018\nand 2017, respectively. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on\nthe transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to\nreduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by\napproximately $92 million and $152 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n \nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price change would result\nin a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $75 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pre-\ntax cost or savings of approximately $42 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3M production and other facilities,\nprimarily electricity and natural gas.\n \nItem 8.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

{"data": "Table of Contents \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \nNOTE 1.  Significant Accounting Policies \n \nConsolidation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All subsidiaries are consolidated.\nAll intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term \u201c3M\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context\nindicates otherwise.\n \nForeign currency translation: Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Assets and liabilities for\noperations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at\nmonth-end exchange rates of each applicable month. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) in shareholders\u2019 equity.\n \n3M has a subsidiary in Venezuela, the financial statements of which are remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent because Venezuela\u2019s\neconomic environment is considered highly inflationary. The operating income of this subsidiary is immaterial as a percent of 3M\u2019s consolidated operating\nincome for 2018. The Venezuelan government sets official rates of exchange and conditions precedent to purchase foreign currency at these rates with local\ncurrency. The government has also operated various expanded secondary currency exchange mechanisms that have been eliminated and replaced from time\nto time. Such rates and conditions have been and continue to be subject to change. For the periods presented, the financial statements of 3M\u2019s Venezuelan\nsubsidiary were remeasured utilizing the rate associated with the secondary auction mechanism, Tipo de Cambio Complementario, which was redesigned\nby the Venezuelan government in June 2017 (DICOM), or its predecessor. During the same periods, the Venezuelan government\u2019s official exchange was\nTipo de Cambio Protegido (DIPRO), or its predecessor. During the third quarter of 2018, the Venezuelan government effected a conversion of its currency\nto the Sovereign Bolivar (VES), essentially equating to its previous Venezuelan Bolivar divided by 100,000. 3M\u2019s uses of these rates were based upon\nevaluation of a number of factors including, but not limited to, the exchange rate the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary may legally use to convert\ncurrency, settle transactions or pay dividends; the probability of accessing and obtaining currency by use of a particular rate or mechanism; and the\nCompany\u2019s intent and ability to use a particular exchange mechanism. The Company continues to monitor these circumstances. Changes in applicable\nexchange rates or exchange mechanisms may continue in the future. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a balance of net monetary liabilities\ndenominated in VES of approximately 30 million VES and the DICOM exchange rate was approximately 556 VES per U.S. dollar.\n \nA need to deconsolidate the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary\u2019s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability of VEF-denominated cash coupled\nwith an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela. 3M monitors factors such as its\nability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company\u2019s ability to manage its Venezuelan subsidiary\u2019s\ncapital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and economic situation within Venezuela. Based upon a review\nof factors as of December 31, 2018, the Company continues to consolidate its Venezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss associated with this subsidiary was approximately $145 million and the amount of intercompany receivables due\nfrom this subsidiary and its total equity balance were not significant.\n \n3M has subsidiaries in Argentina, the operating income of which is less than one half of one percent of 3M\u2019s consolidated operating income for 2018.\nBased on various indices, Argentina\u2019s cumulative three-year inflation rate exceeded 100 percent in the second quarter of 2018, thus being considered highly\ninflationary. As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2018, the financial statements of the Argentine subsidiaries were remeasured as if their functional\ncurrency were that of their parent. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a balance of net monetary assets denominated in Argentine pesos (ARS) of\napproximately 230 million ARS and the exchange rate was approximately 38 ARS per U.S. dollar.\n \nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n \nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.\n61\n \n", "page_num": 61}
{"data": "Table of Contents \n \nMarketable securities: Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost of securities sold use the first in,\nfirst out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M\nreviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320, Investments-Debt and\nEquity Securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as \u201ctemporary\u201d or \u201cother-than-temporary\u201d. A temporary impairment charge results\nin an unrealized loss being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. Such an unrealized loss does not\nreduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate\nbetween temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the\nunderlying collateral, as well as other factors. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or\n\u201cother-than-temporary\u201d impairment.\n \nInvestments: As described in the \u201cNew Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section, 3M adopted ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial\nAssets and Financial Liabilities, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, all equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for\nunder the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity\ninvestments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price\nchanges in orderly transactions. The balance of these securities is disclosed in Note 7.\n \nOther assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and\nother long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any\nchanges in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated\nwith life insurance activity are included in \u201cPurchases of marketable securities and investments\u201d and \u201cProceeds from maturities and sale of marketable\nsecurities and investments,\u201d respectively.\n \nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\n \n Property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost.\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The\nestimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range of twenty to forty years. The\nestimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range of five to ten years. Fully\ndepreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts\nuntil disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal,\nis charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of\nan asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the\nimpairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted\ncash flow analysis.\n \nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of\ntangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations\nexist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the\nliabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related\nassets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $122 million and $106 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n \nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business\ncombination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between\nannual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done\nat a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting\n62\n \n", "page_num": 62}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nunits are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic\ncharacteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying\nvalue of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill. The estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not\n\u201cmore likely than not\u201d less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as \u201cStep 0\u201d. 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill\nassessments.\n \nIntangible assets: Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an\nindependent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from three to twenty years on a systematic and rational basis\n(generally straight line) that is representative of the asset\u2019s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between ten to\nseventeen years, patents largely between four to thirteen years, other technology-based largely between five to fifteen years, definite lived tradenames\nlargely between three and twenty years, and other intangibles largely between five to thirteen years. Intangible assets are removed from their respective\ngross asset and accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. Refer to Note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and\naccumulated amortization of the Company\u2019s intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as\nincurred, within \u201cResearch, development and related expenses.\u201d\n \nIntangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group)\nmay not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset\u2019s or\nasset group\u2019s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of\nthe asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n \nIntangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually,\nand are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be\nimpaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\n \nRestructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs,\nand impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon\ndistributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts\nare estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees were required to\nrender service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable\nemployees and recognized as expense over the employees\u2019 remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to\nterminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will\ncontinue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Asset impairment charges related to intangible\nassets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets\u2019 carrying values over their fair values.\n \nRevenue (sales) recognition: 3M adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and other related ASUs (collectively, ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition approach. See additional disclosure relative to\nadoption of this ASU in Note 2.\n \nThe Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or\nsignificant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3M\u2019s customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer\nmanufactured goods as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not\ndistinct. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-licensing, multiple performance\nobligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and non-standard terms and conditions.\n \n63\n \n", "page_num": 63}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nRevenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Company\u2019s customer arrangements, control transfers to\ncustomers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of\ngoods/services transfers to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the\nbenefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).\n \nRevenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable\nconsideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates,\ntrade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely\namount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes.\nThe range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and\nprojected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across\nbusinesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives.\nThere are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an\nexpense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal\ncourse of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other\nexcise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\n \nFor substantially all arrangements recognized over time, the Company applies the \u201cright to invoice\u201d practical expedient. As a result, 3M recognizes revenue\nat the invoice amount when the entity has a right to invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the\nCompany\u2019s performance completed to date.\n \nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract\u2019s transaction price to each performance obligation using 3M\u2019s best\nestimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.\n \nThe Company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous\nperiods.\n \nThe Company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years\npresented. Additionally, the Company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any\nyear presented.\n \n3M applies ASC 606 utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical expedients:\n\u00b7\nExemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of one year or less.\n\u00b7\nPractical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would\nhave been one year or less.\n\u00b7\nPortfolio approach practical expedient relative to estimation of variable consideration.\n\u00b7\n\u201cRight to invoice\u201d practical expedient based on 3M\u2019s right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the\ncustomer of 3M\u2019s performance completed to date.\n\u00b7\nElection to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\n\u00b7\nSales-based royalty exemption permitting future intellectual property out-licensing royalty payments to be excluded from the otherwise required\nremaining performance obligations disclosure.\n \nAccounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains\nallowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. The allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns is based on the\nbest estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales returns. The Company determines the allowances\nbased on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and historical sales returns. The Company reviews the allowance for\ndoubtful accounts monthly. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\n \nAdvertising and merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $396 million in 2018, $411 million in 2017 and\n$385 million in 2016.\n64\n \n", "page_num": 64}
{"data": "Table of Contents \n \nResearch, development and related expenses: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.821 billion in 2018, $1.870 billion in 2017 and $1.764 billion in\n2016. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and\nimproved products and their uses, totaled $1.253 billion in 2018, $1.352 billion in 2017 and $1.248 billion in 2016. Related expenses primarily include\ntechnical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of\nexternally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved\ninvestments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.\n \n Internal-use software: The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use\nsoftware. Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational\nbasis is more representative of the software\u2019s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or capital leases within\nproperty, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and accumulated\ndepreciation accounts.\n \nEnvironmental: Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are\nexpensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably\nestimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company\u2019s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies.\nEnvironmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated\nuseful lives.\n \nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the\nexpected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a\nvaluation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company\nhad valuation allowances of $67 million and $81 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax\npositions based on the rules under ASC 740, Income Taxes.\n \nEarnings per share: The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M\ncommon shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company\u2019s stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these\nstock-based compensation plans during the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M\ncommon shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (2.9 million average options for 2018, 0.8 million average options for 2017, and\n3.6 million average options for 2016).

These excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax\nbenefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash\nflows related to income taxes. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and\nemployee stock option exercises.\n \nComprehensive income: Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nis composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and\npostretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow\nhedging instruments.\n \nDerivatives and hedging activities: All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are recorded on the balance sheet at\nfair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks\ngenerally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting\nare designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to\nexist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for\nhedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement\nof cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The\nCompany does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.\n \nCredit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity\nprice swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors\nits exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as\ncounterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master\nnetting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate\nderivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of\nderivative assets and liabilities within the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master\nnetting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.\n \nFair value measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring\nthat the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability\ndeveloped based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company\u2019s\nassumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the\ncircumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in\nmarkets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are\nunobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the\nfair value measurement.\n \nAcquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations.  This standard requires the acquiring\nentity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date\nfair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard\nprescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent\nconsideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting.\n66\n \n", "page_num": 66}
{"data": "Table of Contents \n \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n \nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and subsequently\nissued additional ASUs amending this ASU thought 2017 (collectively, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers).  3M adopted ASC 606 on\nJanuary 1, 2018. The Company\u2019s revenue recognition policy under ASC 606 is described earlier in Note 1 and related additional disclosures are included in\nNote 2, Revenue. 3M adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated. Due to the cumulative\nnet impact of adoption, the January 1, 2018 balance of retained earnings was increased by less than $2 million, primarily relating to the accelerated\nrecognition for software installation service and training revenue.\n \nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which revises the\naccounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for\nfinancial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The\nnew guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and other ownership interests in an entity, including investments in\npartnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies (collectively, equity securities) that do not result in consolidation and are not\naccounted for under the equity method. Entities will need to measure these investments and recognize changes in fair value in net income. Entities will no\nlonger be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities they classify under current guidance as available-for-sale in other\ncomprehensive income (OCI). They also will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values. Instead, for these types of equity investments that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient, entities will\nbe permitted to elect a practicability exception and measure the investment at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes (in orderly\ntransactions). The ASU also establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial\nliabilities for which the fair value option (FVO) has been elected. Under this guidance, an entity would be required to separately present in OCI the portion\nof the total fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings. This provision does not\napply to derivative instruments required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. For 3M, this standard was\neffective beginning January 1, 2018 via an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, except for guidance relative to equity\nsecurities without readily determinable fair values which is applied prospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on 3M\u2019s consolidated results\nof operations and financial condition.\n \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and in July 2018, issued ASU No. 2018-10 and 2018-11 and in December 2018, issued\nASU No. 2018-20, which amended the standard, replacing existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard introduces a lessee model that would\nrequire entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current\naccounting. The ASU does not make fundamental changes to existing lessor accounting. However, it modifies what qualifies as a sales-type and direct\nfinancing lease and related accounting and aligns a number of the underlying principles with those of the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, such as\nevaluating how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can be recognized. The guidance eliminates existing real estate-specific\nprovisions and requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2019. As amended, the ASU provides\nfor retrospective transition applied to earliest period presented or an adoption method by which entities would not need to recast the comparative periods\npresented. 3M does not plan on recasting prior periods as it adopts this ASU. 3M has conducted analyses, executed project management relative to the\nprocess of adopting this ASU including implementing a new lease accounting system, conducted detailed contract reviews, considered expanded disclosure\nrequirements, and assessed internal controls impacts. Note 16 provides information regarding rent expense for operating leases and minimum lease\npayments for capital and operating leases under existing lease guidance. While 3M will provide expanded disclosures as a result of ASU No. 2016-02, it\ndoes not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations. However, 3M expects to record approximately $0.8 billion\nof lease assets and lease liabilities related to its operating leases and an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings related to transition upon this ASU\u2019s\nadoption in January 2019.\n \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which revises guidance for the accounting for\ncredit losses on financial instruments within its scope, and in November 2018, issued ASU No. 2018-19, which amended the standard. The new standard\nintroduces an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for\navailable-for-sale debt securities. The new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\n67\n \n", "page_num": 67}

With respect to available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the ASU amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model. For such\nsecurities with unrealized losses, entities will still consider if a portion of any impairment is related only to credit losses and therefore recognized as a\nreduction in income. However, rather than also reflecting that credit loss amount as a permanent reduction in cost (amortized cost) basis of that AFS debt\nsecurity, the ASU requires that credit losses be reflected as an allowance. As a result, under certain circumstances, a recovery in value could result in\nprevious allowances, or portions thereof, reversing back into income. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Entities\nare required to apply the standard\u2019s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in\nwhich the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently assessing this ASU\u2019s impact on 3M\u2019s consolidated result of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which modifies existing guidance and is\nintended to reduce diversity in practice with respect to the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets. The ASU indicates\nthat the current exception to income tax accounting that requires companies to defer the income tax effects of certain intercompany transactions would\napply only to intercompany inventory transactions. That is, the exception would no longer apply to intercompany sales and transfers of other assets (e.g.,\nintangible assets). Under the existing exception, income tax expense associated with intra-entity profits in an intercompany sale or transfer of assets is\neliminated from earnings. Instead, that cost is deferred and recorded on the balance sheet (e.g., as a prepaid asset) until the assets leave the consolidated\ngroup. Similarly, the entity is prohibited from recognizing deferred tax assets for the increases in tax bases due to the intercompany sale or transfer. For\n3M, the ASU was effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated and the January 1,\n2018 balance of retained earnings was decreased by less than $2 million.\n \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which narrows the existing definition of a business and\nprovides a framework for evaluating whether a transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition (or disposal) of assets or a business. The ASU requires\nan entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar\nidentifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities (collectively, the set) is not a business. To be considered a business, the set would need\nto include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The standard also narrows the definition of\noutputs. The definition of a business affects areas of accounting such as acquisitions, disposals and goodwill. Under the new guidance, fewer acquired sets\nare expected to be considered businesses. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2018 on a prospective basis and the Company will apply this guidance\nto applicable transactions after the adoption date.\n \nIn February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05, Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of\nNonfinancial Assets. This ASU addresses scope-related questions that arose after the FASB issued its revenue guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. The new standard clarifies the accounting for derecognition of nonfinancial assets and defines what is considered an in\nsubstance nonfinancial asset. Nonfinancial assets largely relate to items such as real estate, ships and intellectual property that do not constitute a business.\nThe new ASU impacts entities derecognizing (e.g. selling) nonfinancial assets (or in substance nonfinancial assets), including partial interests therein, when\nthe purchaser is not a customer. Under the new guidance, the seller would apply certain recognition and measurement principles of ASU No. 2014-09,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, even though the purchaser is not a customer. For 3M, this new standard was effective coincident with the\nCompany\u2019s January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No. 2014-09.\n \nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit\nCost. This ASU changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost\nin the income statement. Under the new standard, only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost would be included in operating expenses and\nonly the service cost component would be eligible for capitalization into assets such as inventory. All other net periodic benefit costs components (such as\ninterest, expected return on plan assets, prior service cost amortization and actuarial gain/loss amortization) would be reported outside of operating income.\n3M adopted this ASU is effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis; however, guidance limiting the capitalization to only the service cost component\nis applied on prospective basis. The Company previously filed a Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 8, 2018 (which updated 3M\u2019s 2017 Annual Report\non Form 10-K) that provided prior period information reflecting the retrospective adoption of this ASU. The adoption had no impact on previously reported\nincome before income taxes and net income attributable to 3M. However, non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs in prior periods were\nreclassified from operating expenses\n68\n \n", "page_num": 68}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nand are now reported outside of operating income within other expense (income), net. The financial information herein reflects these impacts for all periods\npresented. The prospective impact on costs capitalized into assets was not material.\n \nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which amends the amortization period\nfor certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Under existing standards, entities generally amortize the premium as an adjustment of\nyield over the contractual life of the instrument. The new guidance shortens the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain callable debt\nsecurities that have explicit, noncontingent call features and are callable at a fixed price and preset date. The amendments do not require an accounting\nchange for securities held at a discount. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019 with a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-\neffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. 3M\u2019s marketable security portfolio\nincludes very limited instances of callable debt securities held at a premium. As a result, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact\non 3M\u2019s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based\npayment award must be accounted for as a modification. The general model for accounting for modifications of share-based payment awards is to record\nthe incremental value arising from the changes as additional compensation cost. Under the new standard, fewer changes to the terms of an award would\nrequire accounting under this modification model. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2018. Because the Company does not typically make changes\nto the terms or conditions of its issued share-based payment awards,  the adoption of this ASU had no material impact on its consolidated results of\noperations and financial condition.\n \nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-10, Determining the Customer of the Operation Services, that clarifies how an operating entity determines\nthe customer of the operation services for transactions within the scope of a service concession arrangement. Service concession arrangements are typically\nagreements between a grantor and an operating entity whereby the operating entity will operate the grantor\u2019s infrastructure (i.e. airports, roadways, bridges,\nand prisons) for a specified period of time. The operating entity also may be required to maintain the infrastructure and provide capital-intensive\nmaintenance to enhance or extend its life. In such arrangements, typically the operation services (i.e. operation and maintenance of a roadway) would be\nused by third parties (i.e. drivers). The ASU clarifies that the grantor, not the third party, is the customer of the operation services in such arrangements. For\n3M, this new standard was effective coincident with the Company\u2019s January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. Because the Company is not typically a\nparty to agreements within the scope of accounting for service concession arrangements, the adoption of this ASU had no material impact on its\nconsolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) Replacement\nof the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable\nNoncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception. The new standard applies to issuers of financial instruments with down-round features. A down-round\nprovision is a term in an equity-linked financial instrument (i.e. a freestanding warrant contract or an equity conversion feature embedded within a host debt\nor equity contract) that triggers a downward adjustment to the instrument\u2019s strike price (or conversion price) if equity shares are issued at a lower price (or\nequity-linked financial instruments are issued at a lower strike price) than the instrument\u2019s then-current strike price. The purpose of the feature is typically\nto protect the instrument\u2019s counterparty from future issuances of equity shares at a more favorable price. The ASU amends (1) the classification of such\ninstruments as liabilities or equity by revising the certain guidance relative to evaluating if they must be accounted for as derivative instruments and (2) the\nguidance on recognition and measurement of freestanding equity-classified instruments. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption\npermitted. Because the Company has not issued financial instruments with down-round features, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on\nits consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities and in October 2018, issued ASU No.\n2018-16, which amended the standard. The ASU amends existing guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations and allow\ncompanies to better align their hedge accounting with their risk management activities. Existing standards contain certain requirements for an instrument to\nqualify for hedge accounting relative to initial and ongoing assessments of hedge effectiveness. While an initial quantitative test to establish the hedge\nrelationship is highly effective would still be required, the new ASU permits subsequent qualitative assessments for certain hedges instead of a quantitative\ntest and expands the timeline for performing the initial quantitative assessment. The ASU also simplifies related accounting by eliminating the requirement\nto separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. Instead, for qualifying cash flow and net investment hedges, the entire change\n69\n \n", "page_num": 69}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nin fair value (including the amount attributable to ineffectiveness) will be recorded within other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the\nsame income statement line that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. For fair value hedges,\ngenerally, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument would also be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The new\nstandard also simplifies the accounting for fair value hedges of interest rate risks and expands an entity\u2019s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk\ncomponents. In addition, the guidance also eases certain documentation requirements, modifies the accounting for components excluded from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness, and requires additional tabular disclosures of derivative and hedge-related information. For 3M, this ASU is effective\nJanuary 1, 2019, with a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings as\nof the adoption date. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on 3M\u2019s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which\npermits entities to reclassify, to retained earnings, the one-time income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) arising\nfrom the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. An entity that elects to make this reclassification\nmust consider all items in AOCI that have tax effects stranded as a result of the tax rate change, and must disclose the reclassification of these tax effects as\nwell as the entity\u2019s policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI. The ASU may be applied either retrospectively or as of the beginning of the period\nof adoption. For 3M, this ASU will be adopted effective January 1, 2019 and will result in a reclassification between retained earnings and AOCI. The\nCompany estimates that the impact from this ASU will increase retained earnings by approximately $0.9 billion, with an offsetting increase to accumulated\nother comprehensive loss for the same amount.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which largely aligns the measurement\nand classification guidance for share-based payments to nonemployees with the guidance for share-based payments to employees. The ASU also clarifies\nthat any share-based payment issued to a customer should be evaluated under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The ASU requires a\nmodified retrospective transition approach. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2019. Because the Company does not grant share-based payments\nto nonemployees or customers, this ASU will not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-08, Clarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and Contributions Made.\nThe ASU applies to entities that receive or make contributions, which primarily are not-for-profit entities but also affects business entities that make\ncontributions. In the context of business entities that make contributions, the FASB clarified that a contribution is conditional if the arrangement includes\nboth a barrier for the recipient to be entitled to the assets transferred and a right of return for the assets transferred (or a right of release of the business\nentity\u2019s obligation to transfer assets). The recognition of contribution expense is deferred for conditional arrangements and is immediate for unconditional\narrangements. The ASU requires modified prospective transition to arrangements that have not been completed as of the effective date or that are entered\ninto after the effective date, but full retrospective application to each period presented is permitted. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2019. The\nCompany does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which amends ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The new\nASU includes certain clarifications to address potential narrow-scope implementation issues which the Company is incorporating into its assessment and\nadoption of ASU No. 2016-02. This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as ASU No. 2016-02, which for 3M is January 1, 2019.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which amends ASU No. 2016-02, Leases . The new ASU\noffers an additional transition method by which entities may elect not to recast the comparative periods presented in financial statements in the period of\nadoption and allows lessors to elect a practical expedient to not separate lease and nonlease components when certain conditions are met. This ASU has the\nsame transition requirements and effective date as ASU No. 2016-02, which for 3M is January 1, 2019.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which eliminates, amends, and\nadds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The amended and new disclosure requirements primarily relate to Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020.

The ASU requires a retrospective transition approach. The\nCompany elected to early adopt this ASU in the fourth quarter 2018 on a retrospective basis. As this ASU relates only to disclosures, there was no impact to\nthe Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That\nIs a Service Contract, which aligns the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement (i.e.\nhosting arrangement) with the guidance on capitalizing costs in ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software. The ASU permits either a prospective or retrospective\ntransition approach. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020. The Company is currently assessing this standard\u2019s impact on its consolidated\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-16, Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a\nBenchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes, which adds the OIS rate based on the SOFR to the list of US benchmark interest rates in ASC\n815 that are eligible to be hedged. This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as ASU No. 2017-12, which for 3M is January 1, 2019.\nThe Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-17, Targeted Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities, which changes how\nentities evaluate decision-making fees under the variable interest guidance. Entities will consider indirect interests held through related parties under\ncommon control on a proportionate basis rather than in their entirety. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020. 3M does not have significant\ninvolvement with entities subject to consolidation considerations impacted by variable interest entity model factors. As a result, the Company does not\nexpect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-18, Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606, which clarifies that certain\ntransactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. The ASU\nprecludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue from contracts with customers if the\ncounterparty is not a customer for that transaction. Further, the ASU amends ASC 808 to refer to the unit-of-account guidance in ASC 606 and requires it to\nbe used only when assessing whether a transaction is in the scope of ASC 606. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020. 3M has limited\ncollaborative arrangements. As a result, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n \nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments, which clarifies that receivables\narising from operating leases are not within the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather, should be accounted for in accordance with the lease\nstandard.

Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired\nbusinesses and synergies expected to arise after 3M\u2019s acquisition of these businesses.\n \nIn addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do\nnot otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity.\n \nThere were no acquisitions that closed during 2018.\n \n73\n \n", "page_num": 73}

As of December 31, 2018, the Company has provided $67 million of valuation\nallowance against certain of these deferred tax assets based on management\u2019s determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to\nthese assets will not be realized.\n \nReconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate\n \n \n    \n2018\n    \n2017\n    \n2016\n \nStatutory U.S. tax rate\n \n21.0 %  \n35.0 %  \n35.0 %\nState income taxes - net of federal benefit\n \n1.0  \n0.8  \n0.9  \nInternational income taxes - net\n \n0.2  \n(6.3) \n(2.7) \nGlobal Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI)\n \n1.1  \n \u2014  \n \u2014  \nForeign Derived Intangible Income (FDII)\n \n(1.3) \n \u2014  \n \u2014  \nU.S. TCJA enactment - net impacts\n \n2.5  \n10.1  \n \u2014  \nU.S. research and development credit\n \n(1.5) \n(0.7) \n(0.5) \nReserves for tax contingencies\n \n1.2  \n2.2  \n0.2  \nDomestic Manufacturer\u2019s deduction\n \n \u2014  \n(1.8) \n(1.8) \nEmployee share-based payments\n \n(1.4) \n(3.2) \n(2.8) \nAll other - net\n \n0.6  \n(0.6) \n \u2014  \nEffective worldwide tax rate\n \n23.4 %  \n35.5 %  \n28.3 %\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2018 was 23.4 percent, compared to 35.5 percent in 2017, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points, impacted by several factors.\nPrimary factors that decreased the Company\u2019s effective tax rate included favorable aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) including the decrease in\nthe U.S. income tax rate and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), reduced transitional impact of TCJA related to transition tax and remeasurement of\ndeferred tax assets/liabilities (further discussed below), increased benefits from the R&D tax credit, and favorable adjustment to prior year uncertain tax\nprovisions. These decreases were partially offset by the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the global intangible low-taxed income\n(GILTI) provision, and lower excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments.\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2017 was 35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points, impacted by several factors.\nPrimary factors that increased the Company\u2019s effective tax rate included the impacts due to the TCJA being enacted in 2017 (see further information below)\nand remeasurements and establishment of 3M\u2019s uncertain tax positions. The increase was partially offset by actions which related to international taxes that\nwere impacted by increasing benefits from the Company\u2019s supply chain centers of expertise, changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes and\nprior year cash optimization actions, higher year-on-year excess tax benefit for employee share-based payment, increased benefits from the R&D tax credit,\na reduction of state taxes, and other items.\n \nThe TCJA was enacted in December 2017. Among other things, the TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent\nbeginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that were previously tax\ndeferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provided a\nmeasurement period of up to one year from the TCJA\u2019s enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740. In connection with the\nenactment of the TCJA, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and additional net charges of $176 million as\nmeasurement period adjustments in 2018. As further discussed below, 3M completed its accounting for the income tax effects of enactment of the TCJA as\nfollows:\n \nTransition tax: 3M recorded a provisional income tax expense obligation of $745 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, the Company\nrecorded an additional obligation of $97 million related to the transition tax portion of the TCJA. The TCJA\u2019s transition\n85\n \n", "page_num": 85}

As of December 31, 2018, 3M reflected $649 million in long-term income taxes payable associated with\nthe transition tax.\n \nRemeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts: 3M remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which\nthey are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent under the TCJA. In the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net income tax\nexpense of $17 million related to remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts. During 2018, 3M recorded an additional net tax\nexpense of $79 million as an associated measurement period adjustment.\n \n3M has recorded current tax on GILTI relative to 2018 operations and will continue to account for GILTI as a period cost when incurred.\n \n The IRS has completed its field examination of the Company\u2019s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2005 to 2014, and 2016, but the years have not\nclosed as the Company is in the process of resolving open issues. The Company remains under examination by the IRS for its U.S. federal income tax\nreturns for the years 2015, 2017 and 2018. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign\njurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018, no taxing authority proposed significant adjustments to the Company\u2019s tax positions for which the Company is not\nadequately reserved.\n \nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. The Company has ongoing\nfederal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax\nauthorities and not fully sustained. These uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted in light of facts and circumstances\nincluding progression of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the\nrange by which these potential events could impact 3M\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.  \n \nThe Company recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement.

The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for deferred items, interest and penalties,\nand deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\n \nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the consolidated\nstatement of income on a gross basis approximately $12 million of expense, $20 million of expense, and $10 million of expense in 2018, 2017, and 2016,\nrespectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At\nDecember 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $69 million and $68\nmillion, respectively.

The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1,\n2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while\nemployed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1, 2016. Most international employees and retirees are covered by\ngovernment health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is\ncombined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.\n \n90\n \n", "page_num": 90}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nThe Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained\nto provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For its U.S.\npostretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an\nindependent trustee.\n \nThe Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to substantially all regular\nU.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation matched in\ncash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match\nof 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of\n3% of the participant\u2019s total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees\u2019 elections.\nEmployer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were $173 million, $159 million and $139 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 3M\nsubsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution\nplans were $99 million, $88 million and $87 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n \nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost ,\neffective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. This ASU changed how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement\nbenefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. Under the new standard, only the service cost component of net periodic benefit\ncost is included in operating expenses and only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization into assets such as inventory. All other net periodic\nbenefit costs components (such as interest, expected return on plan assets, prior service cost amortization and actuarial gain/loss amortization) are reported\noutside of operating income. See Note 1 for additional details.\n \nThe following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a\nsummary of the related amounts recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain\nnon-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess benefits for employees impacted by\nparticular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow. The\nobligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet and aggregated less than $40 million as of\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017.\n91\n \n", "page_num": 91}

The contributions\nprovided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5\npercent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.\n \nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement\nbenefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated\nliabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt\ninstruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company\ndetermined a discount rate of 4.36% for the U.S. pension plans and 4.41% for the postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2018, which is an\nincrease of 0.68 percentage points and 0.62 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2017. An increase in the discount rate\nlowers the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), the significant increase in the discount rate as of December 31, 2018 resulted in an approximately $1.2\nbillion lower PBO for the U.S. pension plans. For the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which\nthe associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. If the country has a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the\nexpected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that generate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond\ninformation. In countries that do not have a deep market in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate\ncorporate bond yields. \n \nThe Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs\nare determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-\nspecific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit\nobligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n \nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company\u2019s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.25% in 2018. Projected returns are\nbased primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s 2019 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.00%. The expected return assumption is based on\nthe strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The\n2018 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 23% global equities, 14% private equities, 47% fixed-income\nsecurities, and 16% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment\nmanagement. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2018 was -0.5%. In 2017 the plan earned a rate of return of 12.4% and in 2016 earned a return of\n5.8%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 8.6% and\n94\n \n", "page_num": 94}

The December 31, 2018 update resulted in a small decrease to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated\npostretirement benefit obligations.\n \nDuring 2018, the Company contributed $366 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $4 million to its postretirement plans.

Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and\nother factors.\n \nFuture Pension and Postretirement Benefit Payments\n \nThe following table provides the estimated pension and postretirement benefit payments that are payable from the plans to participants.\n \n \n \nQualified and Non-qualified\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPension Benefits\n \nPostretirement\n \n(Millions)\n    \nUnited States\n    \nInternational\n    \nBenefits\n \n2019 Benefit Payments\n \n$\n1,094  \n$\n240  \n$\n122  \n2020 Benefit Payments\n \n \n1,097  \n \n242  \n \n130  \n2021 Benefit Payments\n \n \n1,105  \n \n258  \n \n139  \n2022 Benefit Payments\n \n \n1,117  \n \n269  \n \n147  \n2023 Benefit Payments\n \n \n1,130  \n \n289  \n \n157  \nNext five years\n \n \n5,683  \n \n1,623  \n \n842  \n \nPlan Asset Management\n \n3M\u2019s investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the funds on a going-concern basis. The primary goal of the trust funds is to\nmeet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without\nsubjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible\nwithin actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional contributions from 3M. The\ninvestment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S.\npension liabilities.\n \nNormally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. However, due to\nexternal investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate amount of 3M securities are not\nconsidered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.\n \nThe discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 15 for descriptions of these\nlevels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies\nor assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n95\n \n", "page_num": 95}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nU.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\n \nIn order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include a target\nstrategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some\ninvestments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. Acceptable ranges have\nbeen designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will\nnormally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary\nof the plans. Approximately 50% of the postretirement benefit plan assets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the\nprimary U.S. pension plan and invested with the same investment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.\n \nThe fair values of the assets held by the U.S. pension plans by asset class are as follows:\n \n \n \nFair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as\n \nFair Value at\n \n(Millions)\n \nLevel 1\n \nLevel 2\n \nLevel 3\n \nDec. 31,\n \nAsset Class\n    \n2018\n    \n2017\n    \n2018\n    \n2017\n    \n2018\n    \n2017\n    \n2018\n    \n2017\n \nEquities\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nU.S. equities\n \n$ 1,369  \n$ 1,568  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n1,369  \n$\n1,568  \nNon-U.S. equities\n \n \n1,234  \n \n1,527  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n1,234  \n \n1,527  \nIndex and long/short equity funds*\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n372  \n \n422  \nTotal Equities\n \n$ 2,603  \n$ 3,095  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n2,975  \n$\n3,517  \nFixed Income\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nU.S. government securities\n \n$ 1,889  \n$ 2,666  \n$\n732  \n$\n484  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n2,621  \n$\n3,150  \nNon-U.S. government securities\n \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n44  \n \n168  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n44  \n \n168  \nPreferred and convertible securities\n \n \n \u2014  \n \n 4  \n \n44  \n \n 2  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n44  \n \n 6  \nU.S. corporate bonds\n \n \n 9  \n \n10  \n \n2,941  \n \n2,904  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n2,950  \n \n2,914  \nNon-U.S. corporate bonds\n \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n475  \n \n614  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n475  \n \n614  \nDerivative instruments\n \n \n 2  \n \n \u2014  \n \n111  \n \n110  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n113  \n \n110  \nOther*\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n 9  \n \n 8  \nTotal Fixed Income\n \n$ 1,900  \n$ 2,680  \n$ 4,347  \n$ 4,282  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n6,256  \n$\n6,970  \nPrivate Equity\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nDerivative instruments\n \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n(7) \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n(7) \nGrowth equity\n \n \n45  \n \n34  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n45  \n \n34  \nPartnership investments*\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n2,064  \n \n2,062  \nTotal Private Equity\n \n$\n45  \n$\n34  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n(7) \n$\n2,109  \n$\n2,089  \nAbsolute Return\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nFixed income and other\n \n$\n28  \n$\n31  \n$\n114  \n$\n102  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n142  \n$\n133  \nHedge fund/fund of funds*\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n1,866  \n \n1,871  \nPartnership investments*\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n429  \n \n335  \nTotal Absolute Return\n \n$\n28  \n$\n31  \n$\n114  \n$\n102  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n2,437  \n$\n2,339  \nCash and Cash Equivalents\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nCash and cash equivalents\n \n$\n412  \n$\n109  \n$\n 4  \n$\n14  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n 1  \n$\n416  \n$\n124  \nRepurchase agreements and derivative margin activity\n \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n(1) \n \n(502) \n \n \u2014  \n \n \u2014  \n \n(1) \n \n(502) \nCash and cash equivalents, valued at net asset value*\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n870  \n \n1,402  \nTotal Cash and Cash Equivalents\n \n$\n412  \n$\n109  \n$\n 3  \n$\n(488) \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n 1  \n$\n1,285  \n$\n1,024  \nTotal\n \n$ 4,988  \n$ 5,949  \n$ 4,464  \n$ 3,896  \n$\n \u2014  \n$\n(6) \n$\n15,062  \n$\n15,939  \nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n$\n(259) \n$\n(253) \nFair value of plan assets\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n$\n14,803  \n$\n15,686  \n \n* In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a\npractical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The\nsettlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during\nwhich the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted\ntransaction.

The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36\nmonths.\n \nCash Flow Hedging \u2014 Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows\nfrom interest payments on forecasted debt issuances. The amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables\nbelow as part of the gain/(loss) recognized in income on the effective portion of derivatives as a result of reclassification from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income. \n \nIn the first six months of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that expired in December 2016 with an aggregate notional\namount of $300 million as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Upon issuance of medium-term\nnotes in September 2016, 3M terminated these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.\n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $200 million as a hedge against\ninterest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. In 2017, the Company entered into additional forward starting interest rate\nswaps with notional amounts of $600 million as hedges against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Prior to the\nissuance of medium-term notes in October 2017, 3M terminated these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within\naccumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.\n \nDuring 2018, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $1.2 billion as hedges\nagainst interest rate volatility associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt. Concurrent with the issuance of the medium-term notes in September\n2018, 3M terminated $500 million of these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial gain within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had a balance of $64 million associated with the after tax net unrealized gain associated with cash flow hedging\ninstruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $7 million (after tax loss) related to forward\nstarting interest rate swaps, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, 3M expects to\nreclassify approximately $55 million and $15 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to earnings in 2019 and\n2020, respectively, and approximately $6 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging losses to earnings after 2020 (with the\nimpact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).\n \nThe location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are provided in the following table.

To help manage borrowing\ncosts, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference\nbetween fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value\nhedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest\nexpense. These fair value hedges are highly effective and, thus, there is no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.\n \nIn November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond due in 2021 for a face amount of 600 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-to-floating\ninterest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond obligation.\n \nIn June 2014, 3M issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an interest rate\nswap to convert $600 million of a $625 million note that is due in 2019 included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month LIBOR\nindex as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.\n \nIn August 2015, 3M issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into two interest rate\nswaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first converted a $450 million three-year fixed rate note\nthat matured in August 2018, and the second converted $300 million of a five-year fixed rate note that is due in 2020 included in this issuance to an interest\nrate based on a floating three-month LIBOR index.\n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200 million that converted the company\u2019s fixed-\nrate medium-term note due 2020 into a floating-rate note as a hedge of its exposure to changes in the fair value that is attributable to interest rate risk.\n \nIn September 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200 million that converted a portion of the Company\u2019s $400\nmillion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 into a floating rate note with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR\nindex as a hedge of its exposure to changes in fair value that are attributable to interest rate risk.\n \n101\n \n", "page_num": 101}

{"data": "Table of Contents \nCredit Risk and Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities of Derivative Instruments:\n \nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and\nforward and option contracts. However, the Company\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to\ncredit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M\nenters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement\nmay allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 3M has International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with 17 applicable banks and financial institutions\nwhich contain netting provisions. In addition to a master agreement with 3M supported by a primary counterparty\u2019s parent guarantee, 3M also has\nassociated credit support agreements in place with 16 of its primary derivative counterparties which, among other things, provide the circumstances under\nwhich either party is required to post eligible collateral (when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds specified thresholds or\nif a counterparty\u2019s credit rating has been downgraded to a predetermined rating). The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these\ncounterparties.\n \n3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when\nderivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide\ninformation as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in\nthe event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the\nCompany would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the\ntransactions.

These estimates include transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments\ndesigned to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\n \nNOTE 15.  Fair Value Measurements \n \n3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nand nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs\nbe used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained\nfrom sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company\u2019s assumptions about the factors market participants\nwould use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three\nlevels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted\nprices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nCategorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n \nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:\n \nFor 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities and certain\nderivative instruments. Derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and net investment hedges. The information in the following paragraphs\nand tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with\nrespect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company\u2019s financial statements on a recurring basis for 2018\nand 2017.\n \n3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n \nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities \u2014 except certain U.S. municipal securities:\n \n106\n \n", "page_num": 106}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nMarketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities.\nMarket prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and\nother third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M\nclassifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2.\nMarketable securities are discussed further in Note 11.\n \nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities \u2014certain U.S. municipal securities only:\n \n3M holds municipal securities with certain cities in the United States as of December 31, 2018. Due to the nature of these securities, the valuation method\nutilized includes referencing the carrying value of the corresponding capital lease obligation as adjusted for additional issuances when 3M sells its assets to\nthe municipality and decreases in the form of bond amortization payments, and as such will be classified as level 3 securities separately. Refer to Note 9 for\nadditional discussion of the non-cash nature of these securities.\n \nDerivative instruments:\n \nThe Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are required to be recorded at fair value. The\nCompany\u2019s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price swaps, interest rate swaps,\nand net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to\nhedge 3M\u2019s net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked\nto a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.\n \n3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, commodity price swaps, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-\ncurrency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include\nforeign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their\nbasis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M\u2019s primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest\nrates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash\nflows model.\n \nThe following tables provide information by level for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFair Value Measurements\n \nDescription\n \nFair Value at\n \nUsing Inputs Considered as\n \n(Millions)\n    December 31, 2018     \nLevel 1\n    \nLevel 2\n    \nLevel 3\n \nAssets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAvailable-for-sale:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nMarketable securities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nCommercial paper\n $\n366  $\n \u2014  $\n366  $\n \u2014  \nCertificates of deposit/time deposits\n \n \n10   \n \u2014   \n10   \n \u2014  \nAsset-backed securities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAutomobile loan related\n \n \n 1   \n \u2014   \n 1   \n \u2014  \nU.S. municipal securities\n \n \n40   \n \u2014   \n \u2014   \n40  \nDerivative instruments \u2014 assets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n \n \n127   \n \u2014   \n127   \n \u2014  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n19   \n \u2014   \n19   \n \u2014  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nLiabilities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nDerivative instruments \u2014 liabilities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n \n \n22   \n \u2014   \n22   \n \u2014  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n31   \n \u2014   \n31   \n \u2014  \n \n107\n \n", "page_num": 107}

The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those\nitems for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M\u2019s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional\ncommitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company\u2019s expected future cash outflows related to purchases.\n \nWarranties/Guarantees:\n \n3M\u2019s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at\napproximately $48 million at December 31, 2018, and $50 million at December 31, 2017. Further information on product warranties are not disclosed, as\nthe Company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans\nwith third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.\n \nRelated Party Activity:\n \n3M does not have any material related party activity.\n \nLegal Proceedings:\n \nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings\nworldwide. These include various products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property,\nand commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental proceedings. Unless otherwise stated, the\nCompany is vigorously defending all such litigation.\n \nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings\n \nMany lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are actual damages and are otherwise\nsubject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily\non estimates and assumptions. The Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities for\nlegal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate\nof the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The\nCompany either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot\nbe made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if\nthe Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\n \nThe Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting\ncomparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has\nconcluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured matters where the Company has taken an accrual, the Company also records receivables for the\namount of insurance that it expects to recover under the Company\u2019s insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not taken an\naccrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in\ndefending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.\n \nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the Company may\nnot ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. A future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or increase in accruals\nfor one or more of these matters could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows\nin the period in which they are recorded. Although the Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, the Company currently believes that\nthe ultimate outcome of legal proceedings or future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the\nCompany. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables\neach period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. Where appropriate, the Company\nmakes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the Company could change in the future.\n110\n \n", "page_num": 110}
{"data": "Table of Contents \n \nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated\ninsurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n \nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to\nrepresent approximately 2,320 individual claimants, compared to approximately 2,230 individual claimants with actions pending at December 31, 2017.\n \nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company\u2019s mask and\nrespirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal\nmine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and\nclaims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products\npreviously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company\npremises.\n \nThe Company\u2019s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects\nthat filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims\nalleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than\nin the past. Over the past twenty years, the Company has prevailed in fourteen of the fifteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described\nbelow). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict  in its favor in two lawsuits \u2013 one in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts state court\nin December \u2013 both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury\nin state court in Kentucky found 3M\u2019s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of\napproximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company has appealed. The\nCompany believes liability in this case is not probable and estimable. In June 2018, the Company also settled a number of coal mine dust lawsuits for an\namount that was not material to the Company.\n \nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended\nmanner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if\nsignificant, are attributable to the Company\u2019s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company\u2019s litigation experience indicates that claims of\npersons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of\nunimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it\nexperienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.\n \nAs previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two other\nmanufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended\ncomplaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker\u2019s\ncompensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. The case was inactive\nfrom the fourth quarter of 2007 until late 2013, other than a case management conference in March 2011. In November 2013, the State filed a motion to\nbifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages proceedings. At the hearing on the motion, the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit. No liability\nhas been recorded for this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not\nable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia, the otherwise minimal\nactivity in this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant\u2019s share of liability may turn on the law\nof joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried.\n \nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\n \nThe Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and historical\nclaims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the\n111\n \n", "page_num": 111}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nnature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company\u2019s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of\nasbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii)\nthe costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims, (collectively, the \u201cClaims Data\u201d). As\npart of its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of Claims\nData on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The\nCompany uses these estimates to develop its best estimate of probable liability.\n \nDevelopments may occur that could affect the Company\u2019s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes\nin (i) the key assumptions underlying the Company\u2019s accrual, including, the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, the average cost of\ndefending and resolving claims, and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims,\nand (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.\n \nAs a result of the Company\u2019s review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities and as a result of the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more\nserious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the Company increased its accruals in 2018 for respirator\nmask/asbestos liabilities by $141 million. In 2018, the Company made payments for legal fees and settlements of $76 million related to the respirator\nmask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $673\nmillion, up $65 million from the accrual at December 31, 2017. This accrual represents the Company\u2019s best estimate of probable loss and reflects an\nestimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper\nend of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting\nthe number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert\nclaims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant\u2019s share of liability\nmay turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in\nestimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company\u2019s estimate of liabilities.\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $4 million. The\nCompany continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company\nwill have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.\n \nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation \u2014 Aearo Technologies\n \nOn April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company purchased the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies (\u201cAearo\u201d). Aearo\nmanufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection\nproducts.\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo\u2019s respirator business (American Optical Corporation,\nWarner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (\u201cCabot\u201d)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in\nnumerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for\nalleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by\nother defendants or generally in the workplace.\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $28 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to\ncurrent and future Aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims. This accrual represents the Company\u2019s best estimate of Aearo\u2019s probable loss and\nreflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against Aearo approaching the year 2050. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for\nsettlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner\nLambert and their respective insurers (the \u201cPayor Group\u201d). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold\nrespiratory products under the \u201cAO Safety\u201d brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure\nof the individual plaintiff. Aearo\u2019s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11,\n1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and\nindemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or\n112\n \n", "page_num": 112}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nsilica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of\ncommerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to\nasbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo\u2019s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to\nhave arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to\npay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with\nCabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\n \nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo\u2019s liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in\nthe number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these\nclaims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure\napplicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor\nGroup including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which\nAearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of\nAearo\u2019s share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these\nliabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.\n \nBecause of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future\nclaims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo\u2019s liabilities, the Company\ncannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo\u2019s liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\n \nEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\n \nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic\nsubstances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private\nparties in the United States and abroad. These laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for\nrestoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will\ncontinue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and\nmodifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with\nenvironmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for\nits operations worldwide.\n \nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980\n(CERCLA) and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of\nenvironmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. The Company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in\nthe United States, at which it may have some liability. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cEnvironmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\u201d that\nfollows for information on the amount of the accrual.\n \nEnvironmental Matters\n \nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including\nperfluorooctanoate (\u201cPFOA\u201d), perfluorooctane sulfonate (\u201cPFOS\u201d), perfluorohexane sulfonate (\u201cPFHxS\u201d), or other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances\n(collectively \u201cPFAS\u201d). As a result of its phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures certain PFAS compounds including PFOA,\nPFOS, PFHxS, and their pre-cursor compounds. The company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately\ntwo years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. The Company\ncontinues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length PFAS compounds, including, but not limited to, pre-cursor compounds to perfluorobutane\nsulfonate (PFBS). These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and\nfluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification\nprocesses associated with the Company\u2019s policies covering the use of all\n113\n \n", "page_num": 113}
{"data": "Table of Contents \npersistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials or as\nbyproducts in some of 3M\u2019s current fluorochemical manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n \nRegulatory activities concerning PFOA and/or PFOS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These\nactivities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. As the database of studies of both\nPFOA and PFOS has expanded, the EPA has developed human health effects documents summarizing the available data from these studies. In\nFebruary 2014, the EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for PFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in\nAugust 2014. In May 2016, the EPA announced lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS at 70 parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the\nprovisional levels established by the EPA in 2009 of 400 ppt for PFOA and 200 ppt for PFOS). Where PFOA and PFOS are found together, EPA\nrecommends that the concentrations be added together, and the lifetime health advisory for PFOA and PFOS combined is also 70 ppt. Lifetime health\nadvisories, which are non-enforceable and non-regulatory, provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at which adverse\nhealth effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration. To collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA\npublished on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including six PFAS, required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by public water\nsystem suppliers to determine the extent of their occurrence. Through January 2017, the EPA reported results for 4,920 public water supplies nationwide.\nBased on the 2016 lifetime health advisory, 13 public water supplies exceed the level for PFOA and 46 exceed the level for PFOS (unchanged from the July\n2016 EPA summary). A technical advisory issued by EPA in September 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples stated that 65 public water\nsupplies had exceeded the combined level for PFOA and PFOS. These results are based on one or more samples collected during the period 2012-2015 and\ndo not necessarily reflect current conditions of these public water supplies. EPA reporting does not identify the sources of the PFOA and PFOS in the public\nwater supplies. EPA has announced a forthcoming management plan.\n \nThe Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste\nassociated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois plants. As previously reported, the\nCompany entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) to address the\npresence of PFAS in the soil at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. Pursuant to a permit issued by ADEM, for approximately\ntwenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing PFAS in fields at its Decatur facility. After a review of the\navailable options to address the presence of PFAS in the soil, ADEM agreed that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former\nsludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that plan continues,\nand construction of the cap was substantially completed in 2018.\n \nThe Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007\nSettlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFAS in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington\nCounty, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the\nCompany\u2019s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or\nalternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (\u201cHBV\u201d) or Health Risk Limit (\u201cHRL\u201d) (i.e., the amount of a\nchemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS\nfor which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS at these sites that are\nnot controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During\n2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and\nWoodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company\u2019s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility.\nDuring the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 3M\ncommenced the remedial option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved\nby the MPCA. Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode. Remediation\nwill continue at the Cottage Grove site during 2019.\n \nIn August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in Cordova,\nIllinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results.\n \n114\n \n", "page_num": 114}
{"data": "Table of Contents \nIn May 2017, the MDH issued new HBVs for PFOS and PFOA. The new HBVs are 35 ppt for PFOA and 27 ppt for PFOS. In connection with its\nannouncement the MDH stated that \u201cDrinking water with PFOA and PFOS, even at the levels above the updated values, does not represent an immediate\nhealth risk. These values are designed to reduce long-term health risks across the population and are based on multiple safety factors to protect the most\nvulnerable citizens, which makes them overprotective for most of the residents in our state.\u201d In December 2017, the MDH issued a new HBV for\nperfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) of 2 ppb. In February 2018, the MDH published reports finding no unusual rates of certain cancers or adverse birth\noutcomes (low birth rates or premature births) among residents of Washington and Dakota counties in Minnesota.\n \nThe EPA announced a four-step action plan in May 2018 regarding PFAS, which includes evaluating the need to set Safe Drinking Water Act maximum\ncontaminant levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS and beginning the steps necessary to designate PFOA and PFOS as \u201chazardous substances\u201d under\nCERCLA. In November 2018, EPA asked for public comment on draft toxicity assessments for two PFAS compounds, including PFBS.\n \nThe U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) within the Department of Health and Human Services released a draft Toxicological\nProfile for PFAS for public review and comment in June 2018. In the draft report, ATSDR proposed draft Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) for PFOS, PFOA\nand several other PFAS. An MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of\nadverse non-cancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs are  not intended to define cleanup or action levels for ATSDR or other\nagencies. In August 2018, 3M submitted comments on the ATSDR proposal, noting that there are major shortcomings with the current draft, especially with\nthe MRLs, and that the ATSDR\u2019s profile must reflect the best science and full weight of evidence known about these chemicals.\n \nIn several states, the state legislature or the state environmental agency have been evaluating or have taken actions related to cleanup standards,\ngroundwater values or drinking water values for PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS.\n \nThe Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such\ncompounds or the consequences of any such actions.\n \nLitigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Alabama\n \nAs previously reported, a former employee filed a putative class action lawsuit in 2002 in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, Alabama (the \u201cSt. John\ncase\u201d), seeking unstated damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and property damage from exposure to\ncertain perfluorochemicals at or near the Company\u2019s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility. The court in 2005 granted the Company\u2019s motion to dismiss\nthe named plaintiff\u2019s personal injury-related claims on the basis that such claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the state\u2019s Workers\nCompensation Act. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel filed an amended complaint in November 2006, limiting the case to property damage claims on behalf of a\nputative class of residents and property owners in the vicinity of the Decatur plant. In June 2015, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding\nadditional defendants, including BFI Waste Management Systems of Alabama, LLC; BFI Waste Management of North America, LLC; the City of Decatur,\nAlabama; Morgan County, Alabama; Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur; and Morgan County, Alabama, d/b/a Decatur Utilities.\n \nIn 2005, the judge \u2013  in a second putative class action lawsuit filed by three residents of Morgan County, Alabama, seeking unstated compensatory and\npunitive damages involving alleged damage to their property from emissions of certain perfluorochemical compounds from the Company\u2019s Decatur,\nAlabama, manufacturing facility that formerly manufactured those compounds (the \u201cChandler case\u201d) \u2013  granted the Company\u2019s motion to abate the case,\neffectively putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues in the St. John case. Despite the stay, plaintiffs filed an amended\ncomplaint seeking damages for alleged personal injuries and property damage on behalf of the named plaintiffs and the members of a putative class. No\nfurther action in the case is expected unless and until the stay is lifted.\n \nIn February 2009, a resident of Franklin County, Alabama, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Franklin County (the \u201cStover case\u201d)\nseeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief based on the application by the Decatur utility\u2019s wastewater treatment plant of wastewater treatment\nsludge to farmland and grasslands in the state that allegedly contain PFOA, PFOS and other perfluorochemicals.

The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive\ndamages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants\u2019 chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS from their manufacturing processes in\nDecatur, have contaminated the water in the Tennessee River at the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment\nprocesses utilized by the Water Authority. In September 2016, the court granted 3M\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 trespass claims with prejudice,\nnegligence claims for personal injuries, and private nuisance claims, and denied the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims for property damage,\npublic nuisance, abatement of nuisance, battery and wantonness.\n \nIn June 2016, the Tennessee Riverkeeper, Inc. (Riverkeeper), a non-profit corporation, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nAlabama against 3M; BFI Waste Systems of Alabama; the City of Decatur, Alabama; and the Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur, Morgan County,\nAlabama. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in connection with the disposal of certain PFAS\nthrough their ownership and operation of their respective sites. The complaint further alleges such practices may present an imminent and substantial\nendangerment to health and/or the environment and that Riverkeeper has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm caused by defendants\u2019 failure\nto abate the endangerment unless the court grants the requested relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief.\n \nIn August 2016, a group of over 200 plaintiffs filed a putative class action against West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water\nAuthority), 3M, Dyneon, Daikin, BFI, and the City of Decatur in state court in Lawrence County, Alabama. Plaintiffs are residents of Lawrence, Morgan\nand other counties who are or have been customers of the Water Authority. They contend defendants have released PFAS that contaminate the Tennessee\nRiver and, in turn, their drinking water, causing damage to their health and properties. In January 2017, the court in the St. John case, discussed above,\nstayed this litigation pending resolution of the St. John case.\n \nIn January 2017, several hundred plaintiffs sued 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, and Daikin America in Lawrence and Morgan Counties, Alabama. The\nplaintiffs are owners of property, residents, and holders of property interests who receive their water from the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and\nSewer Authority (Water Authority). They assert common law claims for negligence, nuisance, trespass, wantonness, and battery, and they seek injunctive\nrelief and punitive damages. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in Decatur that have released\nand continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in discharge into the Tennessee\nRiver. The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants have discharged into Bakers Creek and the Decatur Utilities Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant,\nwhich, in turn, discharges wastewater containing these chemicals into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result of the alleged discharges,\nthe water supplied by the Water Authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with PFOA, PFOS, and related chemicals at a level dangerous to\nhumans.\n \nIn November 2017, a putative class action (the \u201cKing\u201d case) was filed against 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, Daikin America, and the West Morgan-East\nLawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water Authority) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The plaintiffs are residents of\nLawrence and Morgan County, Alabama who receive their water from the Water Authority. They assert various common law claims, including negligence,\nnuisance, wantonness, and fraudulent concealment, and they seek injunctive relief, attorneys\u2019 fees, compensatory and punitive damages for their alleged\npersonal injuries. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in Decatur that have released and\ncontinue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in discharge into the Tennessee\nRiver. The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants have discharged chemicals into the Decatur Utilities Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, which, in\nturn, discharged wastewater containing these chemicals into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result of the alleged discharges, the water\nsupplied by the Water Authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with PFOA, PFOS, and related chemicals at a level dangerous to humans.\n \nIn January 2018, certain property owners in Trinity, Alabama filed a lawsuit against 3M, Dyneon, and three unnamed defendants in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Northern District of Alabama. The plaintiffs assert claims for negligence, strict liability, trespass,\n116\n \n", "page_num": 116}

The plaintiffs seek compensatory and\npunitive damages and a court order directing the defendants to remediate all PFAS contamination on their property. In September 2018, the case was\ndismissed by stipulation of the parties.\n \nIn September 2018, an individual plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama raising allegations and claims\nsubstantially similar to those asserted by plaintiffs in the King case.\n \nLitigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Minnesota\n \nIn July 2016, the City of Lake Elmo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against 3M alleging that the City suffered\ndamages from drinking water supplies contaminated with PFAS, including costs to construct alternative sources of drinking water. The parties mediated in\nAugust 2018 and again in December 2018. Although the parties did not reach a resolution, discussions continue. Trial is scheduled to begin in September\n2019.\n \nState Attorneys General Litigation related to PFAS\n \nIn December 2010, the State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court against 3M to recover damages\n(including unspecified assessment costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees) for alleged injury to, destruction of, and loss of use of certain of the State\u2019s natural\nresources under the Minnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act (MERLA) and the Minnesota Water Pollution Control Act (MWPCA), as well as\nstatutory nuisance and common law claims of trespass, nuisance, and negligence with respect to the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water,\nfish or other aquatic life, and sediments (the \u201cNRD Lawsuit\u201d). The State also sought declarations under MERLA that 3M is responsible for all damages the\nState may suffer in the future for injuries to natural resources from releases of PFAS into the environment, and that 3M is responsible for compensation for\nfuture loss or destruction of fish, aquatic life, and other damages under the MWPCA. In September 2017, the State\u2019s damages expert submitted a report\nthat contended the State incurred $5 billion in damages. In November 2017, the State of Minnesota filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint to seek\npunitive damages from 3M, and 3M filed a motion for summary judgment contending, among other things, that the State\u2019s claims were barred by the\napplicable statute of limitations. In December 2017, the court urged the parties to attempt to resolve the litigation before trial, and in January 2018, the court\nappointed a mediator to facilitate that process. In February 2018, 3M and the State of Minnesota reached a resolution of the NRD Lawsuit. Under the terms\nof the settlement, 3M agreed to provide an $850 million grant to the State for a special \u201c3M Water Quality and Sustainability Fund.\u201d This Fund will enable\nprojects that support water sustainability in the Twin Cities East Metro region, such as continued delivery of water to residents and enhancing groundwater\nrecharge to support sustainable growth. The projects will also result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space\npreservation. 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 associated with\nthe resolution of this matter.\n \nIn June 2018, the State of New York, by its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in Albany Country Supreme Court against 3M, Tyco Fire Products LP,\nChemguard, Inc., Buckeye Fire Equipment Co., National Foam, Inc., and Kidde-Fenwal, Inc., seeking to recover the costs incurred in responding to the\ncontamination caused by Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) manufactured by 3M and others; damages for injury to, destruction of, and loss of the\nState\u2019s natural resources and related recreational series; and property damage.\n \nIn July 2018, the now former governor of Michigan requested that the now former Michigan Attorney General file a lawsuit against 3M and others related\nto PFAS in a public letter. The new Michigan Attorney General has not yet announced whether she will do so.\n \nIn December 2018, the State of Ohio, through its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in the Common Pleas Court of Lucas County, Ohio against 3M, Tyco\nFire Products LP, Chemguard, Inc., Buckeye Fire Equipment Co., National Foam, Inc., and Angus Fire Armour Corp., seeking injunctive relief and\ncompensatory and punitive damages for remediation costs and alleged injury to Ohio natural resources from AFFF manufacturers.\n \nAqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Environmental Litigation\n \n3M manufactured and marketed AFFF for use in firefighting at airports and military bases from approximately 1963 to 2000. As of December 31, 2018, 85\nputative class action and other lawsuits have been filed against 3M and other defendants in various state and federal courts in Arizona, Colorado, Delaware,\nFlorida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington\n117\n \n", "page_num": 117}

In these cases, plaintiffs typically allege that certain PFAS\nused in AFFF contaminated the soil and groundwater where AFFF was used and seek damages for loss of use and enjoyment of properties, diminished\nproperty values, investigation costs, remediation costs, and in some cases, personal injury and funds for medical monitoring. Several companies have been\nsued along with 3M, including Ansul Co. (acquired by Tyco, Inc.), Angus Fire, Buckeye Fire Protection Co., Chemguard, National Foam, Inc., and United\nTechnologies Corp.\n \nIn December 2018, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation granted motions to transfer and consolidate all AFFF cases pending in federal courts\nto the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina to be managed in a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were 85 cases in the MDL.\n \nOther PFAS-related Environmental Litigation\n \n3M manufactured and sold products containing various perfluorooctanyl compounds (PFOA and PFOS), including Scotchgard, for several decades.\nStarting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things,\nthat 3M\u2019s customers\u2019 improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases\ngenerally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated\ngroundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation\ncosts, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell\nInternational Inc. f/k/a Allied-Signal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., and various carpet manufacturers.\n \nIn New York, 3M is defending 22 individual cases and one putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York\nagainst 3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. (\u201cSaint-Gobain\u201d), Honeywell International Inc. (\u201cHoneywell\u201d) and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and\nCompany. Plaintiffs allege that 3M manufactured and sold PFOA that was used for manufacturing purposes at Saint-Gobain\u2019s and Honeywell\u2019s facilities\nlocated in the Village of Hoosick Falls and the Town of Hoosick. Plaintiffs claim that the drinking water around Hoosick Falls became contaminated with\nunsafe levels of PFOA due to the activities of the defendants and allege that they suffered bodily injury due to the ingestion and inhalation of PFOA.\nPlaintiffs seek unstated compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n \nIn Michigan, two putative class actions are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine World Wide\n(Wolverine) and other defendants. The complaints include some or all of the following claims: negligence, trespass, intentional and negligent infliction of\nemotional distress, battery, products liability, public and private nuisance, fraudulent concealment, and unjust enrichment. The actions arise from\nWolverine\u2019s allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes related to their shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M\nScotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3M\u2019s product have contaminated the environment after being disposed of near drinking\nwater sources. In addition to the two federal court class actions, as of December 31, 2018, 3M has been named as defendant in 214 private individual\nactions in Michigan state court based on similar allegations. Wolverine also filed a third-party complaint against 3M in a suit by the State of Michigan\nagainst Wolverine seeking to compel Wolverine to investigate and address contamination associated with its historic disposal activity.\n \nIn Alabama, 3M is defending two lawsuits filed in state court by local public water suppliers relating to 3M\u2019s sale of PFAS-containing products to carpet\nmanufacturers in Georgia. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that the carpet manufacturers improperly discharged PFOA and PFOS into the surface water\nand groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River.\n \nIn Delaware, 3M is defending one putative class action filed in federal court relating to alleged contamination allegedly caused by waste from Wolverine\nWorld Wide, which used Scotchgard in its manufacture of leather products. 3M allegedly supplied Scotchgard to Wolverine.\n \nIn Maine, 3M is defending one individual action in federal court relating to contamination of drinking water and dairy farm operations by PFAS from\nwastewater sludge.

The plaintiff, Occidental Chemical Corporation, alleges that it agreed to\ndesign and pay the estimated $165 million cost to remove and cap sediment containing eight chemicals of concern, including PCBs and dioxins. The\ncomplaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the Company. The Company\u2019s involvement in the case relates to its past use of two\ncommercial drum conditioning facilities in New Jersey. Whether, and to what extent, the Company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the\ncase remains to be determined.\n \nFor environmental litigation matters described above, no liability has been recorded as the Company believes liability in those matters is not probable and\nestimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time.\n \nEnvironmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had recorded liabilities of $25 million for estimated \u201cenvironmental remediation\u201d costs based upon an evaluation\nof currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of $8 million. The Company records\nliabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of\nfeasibility studies or the Company\u2019s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are\nbased primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other\npotentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as\nfurther information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the\napplicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had recorded liabilities of $59 million for \u201cother environmental liabilities\u201d based upon an evaluation of currently\navailable facts to implement the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order with the MPCA (including the best estimate of the probable liability under the\nsettlement of the NRD Lawsuit for interim treatment of municipal and private wells), the remedial action agreement with ADEM, as well as presence in the\nsoil and groundwater at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama, and Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and at two former disposal sites in\nWashington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). The Company expects that most of the spending will occur over the next four years.\n \nIt is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of\napplicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments\nmay occur that could affect the Company\u2019s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the\nenvironmental impact of the Company\u2019s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific\ncompounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and\nevolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of\nother potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors.

The DOL has stated its investigation relates to certain private equity\ninvestments, plan expenses, securities lending, and distributions of plan benefits. In response to certain DOL requests, 3M produced documents and made\nemployees available for interviews. In December 2016, the DOL issued certain subpoenas to 3M and 3M Investment Management Corp. relating to this\ninvestigation. 3M has produced additional responsive documents and is cooperating with the DOL in its investigation. In June 2018, the DOL issued a\nletter indicating that it did not intend to take further action.\n \nProduct Liability Litigation\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company is a named defendant in lawsuits involving approximately 5,015 plaintiffs (compared to approximately 4,270\nplaintiffs at December 31, 2017) who allege the Bair Hugger\u2122 patient warming system caused a surgical site infection. Nearly all of the lawsuits are\npending in federal court in Minnesota. The plaintiffs claim they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later\ndeveloped surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger\u2122 patient warming system (the Bair Hugger\u2122 product line was acquired by 3M as part\nof the 2010 acquisition of Arizant, Inc., a leading manufacturer of patient warming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia and maintain normal body\ntemperature in surgical settings). The complaints seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and\nimplied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and\nviolations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts. One case, from the U.S. District Court for the\nWestern District of Tennessee is a putative nationwide class action. The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nto transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district\nproceeding during the pre-trial phase of the litigation. In 2017, the U.S. District Court and the Minnesota state courts denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motions to\namend their complaints to add claims for punitive damages. At a joint hearing before the U.S. District Court and the Minnesota State court, on the parties\u2019\nmotion to exclude each other\u2019s experts, and 3M\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to general causation, the federal court did not exclude the\nplaintiffs\u2019 experts and denied 3M\u2019s motion for summary judgment on general causation. In January 2018, the state court, in hearing the same arguments,\nexcluded plaintiffs\u2019 experts and granted 3M\u2019s motion for summary judgment on general causation, dismissing all 61 cases pending before the state court in\nMinnesota. Plaintiffs appealed that ruling and the state court\u2019s punitive damages ruling. In January 2019, the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the\nMinnesota state court orders in their entirety. The plaintiffs have indicated that they intend to seek review by the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n \nIn April 2018, the federal court partially granted 3M\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the first bellwether case, leaving for trial a claim for strict liability\nbased upon design defect. The court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claims for negligence, failure to warn, and common law and statutory fraud. In the trial of the\nfirst bellwether case in May 2018, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in 3M\u2019s favor finding that the Bair Hugger\u2122 patient warming system was not\ndefective and was not the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.  The plaintiff appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The plaintiffs\ndismissed the two bellwether cases set for trial in December 2018. Of the other six bellwether cases designated for trial, the plaintiffs have so far dismissed\nfour and agreed to dismiss the fifth, leaving only one. The second bellwether trial is set for May 2019.\n \n3M is also defending two other state court actions. One case is pending in Hidalgo County, Texas and combines Bair Hugger product liability claims with\nmedical malpractice claims. The other state court case is pending in Ramsey County, Minnesota, and was filed after the Minnesota state court\u2019s summary\njudgment ruling.\n \nAn additional state court case was filed in late 2018 in Jackson County, Missouri, combining Bair Hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice\nclaims against Missouri defendants. 3M removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. 3M contemporaneously filed a\nmotion to stay any proceedings in this case pending transfer of the case to the MDL.\n120\n \n", "page_num": 120}

The representative plaintiff seeks relief (including punitive damages) under Canadian law based on theories similar to those asserted in the\nMDL. No liability has been recorded for the Bair Hugger\u2122 litigation because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at\nthis time.\n \nIn September 2011, 3M Oral Care launched Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM dental restorative material. The product was originally indicated for inlay, onlay,\nveneer, and crown applications. In June 2015, 3M Oral Care voluntarily removed crown applications from the product\u2019s instructions for use, following\nreports from dentists of patients\u2019 crowns debonding, requiring additional treatment. The product remains on the market for other applications. 3M\ncommunicated with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as regulators outside the United States. 3M also informed customers and distributors of\nits action, offered to accept return of unused materials and provide refunds.

The plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. The plaintiff seeks\nvarious damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages. In 2019, approximately 26 other lawsuits have been filed\nagainst 3M by former or current military personnel in various state and federal courts in California, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Louisiana, Missouri, Texas,\nFlorida, and the District of Columbia making similar allegations.\n \nFor product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company believes the amount recorded is not\nmaterial to the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Stock-Based Compensation \n \nThe 3M 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 123,965,000 shares of 3M common stock pursuant to awards granted\nunder the plan. Awards may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, progressive stock options, stock appreciation\nrights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining\nshares available for grant under the LTIP Program are 26.3 million and there were approximately 7,700 participants with outstanding options, restricted\nstock, or restricted stock units.\n \nThe Company\u2019s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the performance of\nindividuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees uses the closing stock price on\nthe grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense\nrecognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed ten years of service.\nThis retiree-eligible population represents 38 percent of the annual stock-based compensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based\ncompensation expense is recognized in the first quarter.\n \nIn addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants. The Company\nissues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the issuance of common stock and\nare considered immaterial by the Company.\n \nBeginning in 2016, as a result of the Company\u2019s application of ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, certain\nexcess tax benefits at the time of exercise (for an option) or upon vesting (for restricted stock units) are recognized as income tax benefits in the statement\nof income.

The 2018 performance\ncriteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested capital, free cash flow conversion, and earnings per share growth) were\nselected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value.

Business Segments\n \n3M\u2019s businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M\nmanages its operations in five business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. 3M\u2019s five business\nsegments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient\nsharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial\nintersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated\nindependently, would report the operating income information shown. The difference between operating income and pre-tax income relates to interest\nincome and interest expense, which are not allocated to business segments, along with non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net\nperiodic benefit costs.\n \nAs part of 3M\u2019s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes,\neffective in the first quarter of 2018, and other revisions impacting business segment reporting:\n124\n \n", "page_num": 124}
{"data": "Table of Contents \n \nConsolidation of customer account activity within international countries \u2013 expanding dual credit reporting\n\u00b7\nThe Company consolidated its customer account activity in each country into centralized sales districts for certain countries that make up\napproximately 70 percent of 3M\u2019s 2017 international net sales. Expansion of these initiatives, which previously had been deployed only in the\nU.S., reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual\ncredit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides\ncustomer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. The expansion of alignment of customer accounts within\nadditional countries increased the attribution of dual credit across 3M\u2019s business segments. Additionally, certain sales and operating income\nresults for electronic bonding product lines that were previously equally divided between the Electronics and Energy business segment and the\nIndustrial business segment are now reported similarly to dual credit. As a result, previously reported aggregate business segment net sales and\noperating income for total year 2017 increased $1.568 billion and $402 million, respectively, offset by similar increases in the elimination of dual\ncredit net sales and operating income amounts.\n \nCentralization of manufacturing and supply technology platforms\n\u00b7\nCertain shared film manufacturing and supply technology platform resources formerly reflected within the Electronics and Energy business\nsegment were combined with other shared and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated. This\nchange resulted in a decrease in previously reported net sales and an increase in operating income for total year 2017 of $1 million and $42\nmillion, respectively, in the Electronics and Energy segment, offset by a corresponding increase in net sales and decrease in operating income\nwithin Corporate and Unallocated.\n \nIn addition, as discussed in Note 1, 3M adopted ASU N0. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic\nPostretirement Benefit Cost, effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. As a result, operating income for 3M\u2019s business segments has been revised\nto reflect non-service cost related pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs within other expense (income), net\n \nThe financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.\n \nBusiness Segment Products\n \nBusiness Segment\n    \nMajor Products\nIndustrial\n \nTapes, coated, nonwoven and bonded abrasives, adhesives, advanced ceramics, sealants, specialty materials, filtration\nproducts, closure systems for personal hygiene products, acoustic systems products, automotive components,\nabrasion-resistant films, structural adhesives and paint finishing and detailing products\n \n \n \nSafety and Graphics\n \nPersonal protection products, transportation safety products, commercial graphics systems, commercial cleaning and\nprotection products, floor matting, roofing granules for asphalt shingles, fall protection products, self-contained\nbreathing apparatus systems, and gas and flame detection instruments\n \n \n \nHealth Care\n \nMedical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, drug delivery systems, dental and\northodontic products, health information systems and food safety products\n \n \n \nElectronics and Energy\n \nOptical films solutions for electronic displays, packaging and interconnection devices, insulating and splicing\nsolutions for the electronics and electrical industries, touch screens and touch monitors, renewable energy component\nsolutions, and infrastructure protection products\n \n \n \nConsumer\n \nConsumer and office tapes and adhesives, repositionable notes, indexing systems, home improvement products,\nfurnace filters, painter tapes, mounting products, home care products, sponges, scouring pads, high-performance\nclothes, protective material products, and adhesive bandages and braces\n \n125\n \n", "page_num": 125}

Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is\nsubject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n \n3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. Management evaluates\neach of its five business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth.\nAs a result, 3M reflects additional (\u201cdual\u201d) credit to another business segment when the customer account activity (\u201csales district\u201d) with respect to the\nparticular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division\nlevel. For example, certain respirators are primarily sold by the Personal Safety Division within the Safety and Graphics business segment; however, a sales\ndistrict within the Industrial business segment provides the contact for sales of the product to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling\nsegment (Industrial) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales district and the related approximate operating income.\nThe assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such\nsales. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled \u201cElimination of Dual Credit,\u201d such that sales and\noperating income in total are unchanged.\n126\n \n", "page_num": 126}

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures\u201d (as defined in the Exchange\nAct Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n \nb. The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in\nthe Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the\nframework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective. The\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered\npublic accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.\n \nc. There was no change in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company\u2019s most recently completed fiscal\nquarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\n \nThe Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain\nfinancial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The implementation of a\nworldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.\n \nThe Company completed implementation with respect to various processes/sub-processes in certain subsidiaries/locations, including aspects relative to the\nUnited States, and will continue to roll out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement,\nthis application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for\neffectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of its evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the\nimplementation of the ERP system in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting.\n \nItem 9B.

{"data": "EXHIBIT 10.24\n3M COMPENSATION PLAN FOR NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTORS\nARTICLE 1 \nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n1.1.\n Objective.    It is the intent of 3M Company (\u201c3M\u201d) to provide a compensation program that will attract and\nretain highly qualified individuals to serve as nonemployee members of 3M\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d).  This program will\nbe called the \u201c3M Compensation Plan for Nonemployee Directors\u201d (the \u201cPlan\u201d).  This amendment and restatement of the Plan is\neffective January 1, 2019 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d). \n1.2.\n Components of Compensation.  Each nonemployee member of the Board (each, a \u201cNonemployee Director\u201d)\nwill be eligible to receive a base annual retainer, one or more additional annual retainers for service as chair of one or more Board\ncommittees, an additional annual retainer for service as the lead independent director, and other fees.  All retainers and other fees\nprovided to the Nonemployee Directors will be paid at such times, in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions set forth\nin this Plan and as the Board may determine to be appropriate, subject to any limitations set forth from time to time in the 3M\nCompany 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan or any successor thereto (the \u201cLTIP\u201d).\nFor purposes of the Plan, the term \u201cAnnual Stock Retainer\u201d refers to the portion of the retainers and other fees that the Board\ndetermines will be paid only in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (\u201cShares\u201d), deferred stock units (\u201cDSUs\u201d) or a combination of\nShares and DSUs and the term \u201cAnnual Cash Retainer\u201d refers to all other retainers and fees.\n1.3.\n Conversion of Amounts to Shares/DSUs.  Unless otherwise specified by the Board or set forth herein, the\nnumber of Shares or DSUs to be issued, transferred or credited on any given date in respect of a cash-based amount will be\ndetermined by dividing (a) such amount (as converted into U.S. dollars, if necessary, on such basis as may reasonably be determined\nby the Company in its discretion) by (b) the closing sales price (rounded to the nearest cent) for a Share as quoted on the New York\nStock Exchange for the last trading day immediately preceding the initial payment date determined in accordance with the terms of\nthe Plan (i.e., without regard to any delay for administrative convenience), rounded up to the nearest thousandth of a share or DSU, as\napplicable. \n1.4.\n Vesting; Restrictions.  Except as set forth in Section 3.5, as required by applicable law or as otherwise specified\nby the Board, (i) DSUs awarded in accordance with the terms of the Plan as payment for services rendered as a Nonemployee\nDirector will be fully vested, and (ii) Shares issued or transferred in accordance with the terms of the Plan as payment for services\nrendered as a Nonemployee Director will be fully vested and unrestricted Shares.\n1.5.\n Administration.  The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) of the\nBoard.  The Committee has the authority to take all actions and make all determinations under the Plan, to interpret the Plan and to\nadopt, amend and repeal Plan administrative rules, guidelines and practices as it deems advisable.  The Committee may correct\ndefects and ambiguities, supply omissions, reconcile inconsistencies in the Plan and make all other determinations that that it deems\nnecessary or appropriate to administer the Plan.  The Committee\u2019s determinations under the Plan are in its sole discretion and will be\nfinal and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan or any award.\n \n", "page_num": 135}

Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Annual Cash Retainer will be paid in cash\nor such other medium as may be selected by the Nonemployee Director in accordance with Section 4.1.\n2.3.\n Timing of Payment.  The Annual Cash Retainer will be paid (or credited to the Nonemployee Director\u2019s\nmemorandum account) in arrears in four equal installments, on or as soon as administratively practicable following the third trading\nday after the issuance of the quarterly earnings press release for the calendar quarter in which such fees were earned, unless otherwise\nspecified by the Board.  For example, if the quarterly earnings press release for the first quarter of calendar year 2019, is issued on\nApril 24, 2019, the portion of the Annual Cash Retainer earned during the first quarter of calendar year 2019 generally would be\npaid on or about April 29, 2019.\n2.4.\n Proration for New or Departing Directors; Special Appointments.   The Annual Cash Retainer for a new or\ndeparting Nonemployee Director will be prorated based on the number of days within the calendar quarter during which a participant\nserves as a Nonemployee Director.   For avoidance of doubt, additional cash retainers or fees for service pursuant to a special\nappointment (e.g., Chair of the Board or one or more Board committees, lead independent Director) constituting part of the Annual\nCash Retainer will be prorated separately based on the number of days within the calendar quarter during which a participant serves\nin the role for which such fees are provided. \nARTICLE 3 \nANNUAL STOCK RETAINER\n3.1.\n In General.  This Article 3 applies to the Annual Stock Retainer. \n3.2.\n Medium of Payment.

The initial Annual Stock Retainer for an individual whose appointment or\nelection to serve as a Nonemployee Director becomes effective on a date other than the date of an annual meeting of the Company\u2019s\nstockholders will be prorated by multiplying the full amount of the Annual Stock Retainer that otherwise would have been payable to\nsuch individual (assuming that he or she had been elected to serve as a Nonemployee Director at the Annual Meeting of the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders immediately preceding his or her appointment or election) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum\nof (a) three hundred and sixty-five (365)\n2\n \n", "page_num": 136}

A Nonemployee Director may revoke an election prior to the\nbeginning of the calendar year for which it applies.  A Nonemployee Director may make a separate payment election for each\ncalendar year. \n(b)\n New Directors.  Unless otherwise determined by the Board, a Nonemployee Director initially elected or\nappointed to the Board after the beginning of a calendar year may elect, by written notice to 3M delivered not later than 30 days after\nsuch Nonemployee Director\u2019s term begins, to receive payment in an alternative form made available to continuing Nonemployee\nDirectors in accordance with Section 4.1(a) above but only with respect to unpaid amounts earned during the portion of the calendar\nyear  following the date on which the election becomes effective and irrevocable (e.g., the portion of the Annual Cash Retainer\nattributable to service as a Nonemployee Director after such date, as determined in a manner consistent with Section 2.4).  Unless the\nterms of the payment election provide otherwise, the Nonemployee Director will have the right to revoke an election made under this\nSection 4.1(b) until the end of the last day permitted for making such an election.

For each Nonemployee Director who receives all or a portion of his or her Annual Cash\nRetainer in the form of Deferred Cash, 3M will establish a memorandum account and will credit such memorandum account for\namounts of Deferred Cash earned. Such   amounts will be credited as of the date(s) on which they otherwise would be paid in cash\npursuant to Section 2.3 absent a deferral election.  A separate memorandum account will be established for each calendar year.\n(a)\n Accrual of Interest.  Interest will accrue on each memorandum account from the date on which amounts\nare credited to the memorandum account through the date immediately preceding the date of any distribution.\n(b)\n Compounding.  Interest will be compounded on the last day of each calendar quarter.\n3\n \n", "page_num": 137}

Each DSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company\u2019s common stock.  A separate\nmemorandum account will be established for each calendar year.\n(a)\n Crediting of DSUs.  DSUs will be credited to a Nonemployee Director\u2019s memorandum account as of the\nsame date that payment otherwise would be made pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 3.3, as applicable, if paid currently.\n(b)\n Number of DSUs Credited.  The number of DSUs credited to a Nonemployee Director\u2019s memorandum\naccount will be determined as follows:\n(i)\n with respect to DSUs credited to a Nonemployee Director\u2019s memorandum account in respect of\nany retainers and fees earned that otherwise would be payable in Shares, the number of DSUs credited will equal the\nnumber of Shares that otherwise would have been issued or transferred to the Nonemployee Director.\n(ii)\n with respect to DSUs credited to a Nonemployee Director\u2019s memorandum account in respect of\nany retainers and fees earned that otherwise would be payable in cash, the number of DSUs credited will be determined in\naccordance with Section 1.3.\n(c)\n Voting and Dividends.  A Nonemployee Director will not have any right to vote or receive dividends\nwith respect to any Shares underlying the DSUs credited to his or her account unless and until he or she becomes the record holder of\nsuch Shares.\n(d)\n Dividend Equivalents.  For each ordinary cash dividend paid on the shares of the Company\u2019s common\nstock, each Nonemployee Director\u2019s memorandum account will be credited with an additional number of DSUs on the applicable\ndividend payment date for such ordinary cash dividend.
